Nice. You've done great work. I noticed a few typos :

> Gender mainstreaming is an active process[49] that considers the effects of **polices** on both women and men before decisions are made.[40] The Commission should have a gender mainstreaming strategy that considers the impacts of policies and programmes on men.

"polices" should probably be "policies", no ?

> The Commission should:

> - Provide clear pathways for men and men's advocates to engage with them about men's human rights;
>     

> - Identify barriers for men and men's advocates in engaging with the Commission;
>     

> - Ensure men know that they can, and how they can, **access access** the Commission;
>     

You've put access twice

> - Areas where men lack equality with women in practice;
>     

> - The effects of polices and practices on men, including apparently gender-neutral polices and practices;
>     

Polices, once again, instead of policies. Are the two equivalents ? English is not my native language.

> Societal attitudes toward male victims of sexual violence, especially victims of female perpetrators. e.g. Do male victims of women see themselves as victims of crime? How many people think men **cannot be rape** by a woman?

Should be "cannot be raped"

> The availability and accessibility of publicly funded health-care services to prevent, detect and **treat illness and conditions** specific to men. For example, prostate cancer, erectile dysfunction and other male reproductive issues ;

Should be "treat illnesses and conditions"

> Circumcision of boys is a controversial area of human rights, even so, States have **an obligation to protect equally protect girls and boys** from harmful practices.12 

There's a "protect" in excess

> Undermines universality of human rights by implying **it** women's rights are more important than men's.

"It" should be removed 

> Changes to laws, policies, and practices to prevent systemic and structural discrimination of men and boys, for example:

> - **The repeal/revision discriminatory laws;**
>     

Should be "The repeal/revision **of** discriminatory laws;"

> Accountability measures to ensure discrimination against men and boys addressed and there is suitable mechanism for redress;

Should be "Accountability measures to ensure discrimination against men and boys **is** addressed and there is suitable mechanism for redress;"

> The Commission should "actively evaluate the effectiveness of its activities" **and should "should examine the quality** of the NHRI's programmes and the extent to which existing programmes sufficiently address the human rights issues"[73] for men and boys.

There's a "should" in excess

Given the amount of work it is, I'm amazed, you have my deep respect (well, you already had it, but still. Have a kind word from an internet stranger)

Like I said, great work.

A few suggestions based on personal preference, do with it whatever you want

> The belief that men, as a group, receive unearned benefits from society is a stereotype that undermines the protection of men's rights. **In some situations, men may receive unearned benefits, but in other situations they do not.** An objective assessment of human rights requires accepting that all people can suffer human rights violations.

I might have said

"In some situations, men may receive unearned benefits, but in other situations they face undue hardships"

Just because not receiving unearned benefits should be the goal for everyone and is not the same thing as being discriminated against.

> A 'temporary special measure' is a difference in treatment to alleviate the effect of discrimination from certain groups. The Commission should monitor temporary special measures in two ways. Firstly, to identify areas where temporary special measures are appropriate for men and boys and whether or not they are being implemented. Failing to apply temporary special measures to men when they would be applied to women in the same situation is discrimination. Secondly, to ensure that temporary special measures for women are properly implemented and not discriminatory against men.

This is something that I noticed previously: there's a conflict with the definition of discrimination and the possibility to implement such things. Such things fall under the definition of discrimination.

In my opinion, such things should probably not be tolerated. There's nothing more permanent than governmental temporary measures. You do not fuck for virginity, and you do not discriminante for equality. 

But if we were to accept such things, I see several points that need to be stressed much more :

The first is to make absolutely sure that the negative effect it is supposed to combat is really the result of the discrimination it targets.

Very often, we see people argue, for example, that because black people in the US are underrepresented in certain universities, it is because of discrimination against black people in the education system or in society. But those claims are often made in 3 steps : 1 : notice a discrepancy 2 : assert it must be due to discrimination, and 3 : that discrimination is about race.

Though, a big factor may well be the culture of the people, and people raised under the same culture, typically one that devaluates education, end up with the same kinds of results.

As such, instituting a temporary measure to counter a discrimination about race may be absolutely ineffective to affect majorly the discrepancy it targets, because discrimination might be just a small part of the problem at best.

In the same manner, if we were to implement an automatic discount for male criminals, while it would counter some of the anti-male bias, we would still end up with more male convicts anyway because a lot of what drives men to crime is the need to be perceived as providers, to be seen as strong and powerful, etc, which isn't a cultural pressure on women. And there might be as well biological differences due to the impact of testosterone on risk taking.

And so, the temporary measure will not correct the discrimination and will be unfair. And if we remove it, given that the discrimination comes from people in the system noticing more men committing crimes, it might just come back.

The second thing is to make sure that, even if there is really a discrimination that is the main problem that needs to be fixed, the temporary measure will be effective at fixing it.

The third is to put a time limit in it. Like I said, there's nothing more permanent than government temporary. The measures that were implemented because women were lagging behind in education are still there now that men are lagging behind even more. The "temporary" had no time limit. Or any other kind of limit which would make it disappear.

Any temporary measure should come in with at least a time limit, and possibly also an effectiveness measure that make it caducous. I suggest you be more specific in your point "should be temporary"

> Discrimination against single men in renting, especially in State housing, or emergency accommodation

I'm not sure how and where to put it, because it is somewhere between housing and custody, but discrimination against single men in housing might also turn out to be discrimination in custody a dnnbe a self perpetuating problem : men are not given custody, so they are single and often thrown out of the shared house they had with their ex and their kids, and to have the right to get custody of their kids, they need a please to live and house them. So, not getting custody makes them single and thus less prioritised than women with children for housing, but this lower priority makes them struggle to get custody as they can't house their children.
