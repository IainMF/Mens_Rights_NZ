## The right to health
 Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights affirms men's right to the highest attainable standard of health.

>  **Article 12**
> 1. The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.
> 2. The steps to be taken by the States Parties to the present Covenant to achieve the full realization of this right shall include those necessary for:
	- a) The provision for the reduction of the stillbirth-rate and of infant mortality and for the healthy development of the child;
> - b) The improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene;
> - c) The prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases;
> - d) The creation of conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness.

The right to health includes the freedom to control one's own body and  to be free from non-consensual medical treatment. The right to health entitles men and boys to a health system that protects their health on an equal basis with women and girls.[^2]

Although the government has the obligation to ensure men and boys have the highest attainable standard of health, factors such as genetics and lifestyle choices significantly influence men's health. Therefore, " the right to health must be understood as a right to the enjoyment of a variety of facilities, goods, services and conditions necessary for the realization of the highest attainable standard of health."[^3]

## Obligations

> The right to health, like all human rights, imposes three types or levels of obligations on States parties: the obligations to *respect*, *protect* and *fulfil*. In turn, the obligation to *fulfil* contains obligations to facilitate, provide and promote. The obligation to *respect* requires States to refrain from interfering directly or indirectly with the enjoyment of the right to health. The obligation to *protect* requires States to take measures that prevent third parties from interfering with article 12 guarantees. Finally, the obligation to *fulfil* requires States to adopt appropriate legislative, administrative, budgetary, judicial, promotional and other measures towards the full realization of the right to health.[^4]

### Respect
Respecting rights means not violating rights. In reagrd to the right to health:


- refraining from denying or limiting equal access for all persons … to preventive, curative and palliative health services
- abstaining from imposing discriminatory practices relating to women’s health status and needs
- abstaining from applying coercive medical treatments
- refrain from limiting access to contraceptives and other means of maintaining sexual and reproductive health, 
- refrain from from censoring, withholding or intentionally misrepresenting health-related information.

### Protect
- adopt legislation or to take other measures ensuring equal access to health care and health-related services provided by third parties
- to ensure that medical practitioners and other health professionals meet appropriate standards of education, skill and ethical codes of conduct
- States are also obliged to ensure that harmful social or traditional practices do not interfere with access to pre- and post-natal care
and family planning; to prevent third parties from coercing women to undergo traditional practices, e.g. female genital mutilation; and to take measures to protect all vulnerable or marginalized groups of society, in particular women, children, adolescents and older persons, in the light of gender-based expressions of violence.

## Fulfil
- give sufficient recognition to the right to health in the national political and legal systems, preferably by way of legislative implementation, and to adopt a national health policy with a detailed plan for realizing the right to health.
- ensure equal access for all to the underlying determinants of health
- the promotion of medical research and health education, as well as information campaigns, in particular with respect to HIV/AIDS, sexual and reproductive health, ==traditional practices, domestic violence==, the abuse of alcohol and the use of cigarettes, drugs and other harmful substances
- States are also required to adopt measures against environmental and occupational health hazards and against any other threat as demonstrated by epidemiological data

#### Facilitate
- requires States inter alia to take positive measures that enable and assist individuals and communities to enjoy the right to health

#### Provide
- States parties are also obliged to fulfil (provide) a specific right contained in the Covenant when individuals or a group are unable, for reasons beyond their control, to realize that right themselves by the means at their disposal

#### Promote

The obligation to fulfil (promote) the right to health requires States to undertake actions that create, maintain and restore the health of the population. Such obligations include:

- (i) fostering recognition of factors favouring positive health results, e.g. research and provision of information;
-  (ii) ensuring that health services are culturally appropriate and that health-care staff are trained to recognize and respond to the specific needs of vulnerable or marginalized groups; 
- (iii) ensuring that the State meets its obligations in the dissemination of appropriate information relating to healthy lifestyles and nutrition, harmful traditional practices and the availability of services;
-  (iv) supporting people in making informed choices about their health.





The right to health obligates the government to ensure health care is *available*, *accessible*, *acceptable*, and of good *quality*.[^5]

### Availability
 
 Health services must be available in sufficient quantity to everyone. Healthy food, water and housing and other determinates of health must be available. 
### Accessible
Health facilities, goods and services must be accessible to everyone without discrimination. 
### Acceptability
Health services must be acceptable to everyone, including men and boys. Services must respect medical ethics and treat men with respect. They must be sensitive to men's specific requirements and issues.
### Quality
Health services must be of good quality.

 Article 12.2 (b) requires the government to ensure workplace safety as best possible and to discourage harmful uses of alcohol and drugs.[^6] 

## Equality & Non-discrimination
Article 2 and 3 of ICESCR prohibit discrimination against men, including in the right to health. 

> States have a special obligation … to prevent any discrimination on internationally prohibited grounds in the provision of health care and health services, especially with respect to the core obligations of the right to health. Inappropriate health resource allocation can lead to discrimination that may not be overt.[^7]

Non-discrimination in the right to health is an immediate obligation.[^8]

Non-discrimination is a 'core obligation'
> To ensure the right of access to health facilities, goods and services on a non-discriminatory basis, especially for vulnerable or marginalized groups;[^9]

> (e) To ensure equitable distribution of all health facilities, goods and services;[^9]

> The formulation and implementation of ==national health strategies== and plans of action should respect, inter alia, the principles of ==non-discrimination== and people’s participation.[^10]

> **Gender perspective**
> 20. The Committee recommends that States integrate a gender perspective in their health-related policies, planning, programmes and research in order to promote better health for both women and men. A gender-based approach recognizes that biological and sociocultural factors play a significant role in influencing the health of men and
women. The disaggregation of health and socio-economic data according to sex is essential for identifying and remedying inequalities in health.

### Children
See also CRC
> Implementation of the principle of non-discrimination requires that girls, as well as boys, have equal access to adequate nutrition, safe environments, and physical as well as mental health services. There is a need to adopt effective and appropriate measures to abolish harmful traditional practices affecting the health of children, ==particularly girls==, including early marriage, female genital mutilation, preferential feeding and care of male children. Children with disabilities should be given the opportunity to enjoy a fulfilling and decent life and to participate within their community.[^11]

> In all policies and programmes aimed at guaranteeing the right to health of children and adolescents their best interests shall be a primary consideration.[^12]

## Limitations
The right to health should not be used as an excuse to violate other rights. If violations of other rights are necessary to protect the public health, they measures must be proportional and time-limited.[^13]

## Progressive realisation
Limited resources mean that the right to health cannot be realised immediately, therefore states have an obligation to progressively realise the right to health. States must take deliberate and concrete steps to the full realisation of the right to health.[^14]

## Violations
see ICESCR General Comment 14 paragraph 46 onward


> **Preventable mortality rates were 2.5 times higher among men than among women across OECD countries** (185 per 100 000 population for men compared with 73 for women). Similarly, mortality rates from treatable causes were about 36 women, with a rate of 86 per 100 000 population for men compared with 63 for women. These gender gaps are explained by higher mortality rates among men, which are in part linked to different exposure to risk factors such as tobacco smoking (see indicator "Main causes of mortality" and Chapter 4 for an in-depth analysis of risk factors for health).[^15]

## SUDI

Citation: Ministry of Health. 2022. *Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy: An analysis of coronial SUDI Liaison Reports from Sept 2018 to June 2020 with subsequent recommendations*. Wellington: Ministry of Health.

> . ==Sixty-one percent of the infants were male==, similar to most other reported series of SUDI infants.

> Sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) is the collective term used to describe any unexpected death of an infant (a child under one-year-old) – with neither the parents nor health professionals having any expectation of it happening. It is a broader term than sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS, often previously known as ‘cot death’), which is defined as an infant death where an on-site investigation and a post-mortem, does not identify a cause of death. SUDI therefore includes infant deaths where coroners’ pathologists declare the death ‘unascertained’, as well as deaths in circumstances of high risk, such as when the infant is found face down into soft bedding or dies during bed sharing.
