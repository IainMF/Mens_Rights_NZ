## The right to health
 Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights affirms men's right to the highest attainable standard of health.

> #### Article 12
> 1. The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.
> 2. The steps to be taken by the States Parties to the present Covenant to achieve the full realization of this right shall include those necessary for:
	> 	- a) The provision for the reduction of the stillbirth-rate and of infant mortality and for the healthy development of the child;
> - b) The improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene;
> - c) The prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases;
> - d) The creation of conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness.

The right to health includes the freedom to control one's own body and  to be free from non-consensual medical treatment. The right to health entitles men and boys to a health system that protects their health on an equal basis with women and girls.[^2]

Although the government has the obligation to ensure men and boys have the highest attainable standard of health, factors such as genetics and lifestyle choices significantly influence men's health. Therefore, " the right to health must be understood as a right to the enjoyment of a variety of facilities, goods, services and conditions necessary for the realization of the highest attainable standard of health."[^3]

The right to health obligates the government to ensure health care is *available*, *accessible*, *acceptable*, and of good *quality*.[^4]

### Availability
 
 Health services must be available in sufficient quantity to everyone. Healthy food, water and housing and other determinates of health must be available. 
### Accessible
Health facilities, goods and services must be accessible to everyone without discrimination. 
### Acceptability
Health services must be acceptable to everyone, including men and boys. Services must respect medical ethics and treat men with respect. They must be sensitive to men's specific requirements and issues.
### Quality
Health services must be of good quality.

> . ==Sixty-one percent of the infants were male==, similar to most other reported series of SUDI infants.

> Sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) is the collective term used to describe any unexpected death of an infant (a child under one-year-old) – with neither the parents nor health professionals having any expectation of it happening. It is a broader term than sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS, often previously known as ‘cot death’), which is defined as an infant death where an on-site investigation and a post-mortem, does not identify a cause of death. SUDI therefore includes infant deaths where coroners’ pathologists declare the death ‘unascertained’, as well as deaths in circumstances of high risk, such as when the infant is found face down into soft bedding or dies during bed sharing.
