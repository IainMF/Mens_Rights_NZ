Some of the human rights issues men and boys face are long-term, persistent issues.
## Conscription

Men are forced to fight in wars and other armed conflict throughout history. Modern conscription often only applies to men.

## Circumcision
 Non-therapeutic circumcision is a violation of body integrity and autonomy. Approximately one third of all men have been circumcised.

## Work-place injuries & fatalities
 Men are the vast majority of serious workplace injuries and fatalities.

## Discrimination in the justice system
Men are treated more harshly in the justice system. Criminal law sometimes explicitly discriminates against men and men receive longer sentences for the same crimes.

## Life-expectancy
Men have shorter life-expectancy than women.
### Women and children first

## Homicide
Worldwide, most homicide vcitms are male.

## Gendercide
For example, targeting on 'fighting-age men' in armed conflict, whether they are combatants or not.

## Suicide
Suicide disproportionately affects men. 

The Health New Zealand Te Whatu Ora Mortality Collection[^1] reports between 1948 and 2020, 20571 males and 7302 females died from intentional self harm. For every female suicide there were approximately 2.8 male suicides. As percentages, 73.8\% of suicides were male and 26.2\% were female.
