> [!tip] This page is a work in progress


A State's human rights obligations are divided into three broad categories. Respect, protect, and fulfil. The obligation to **respect**, means that the government must not violate the rights of men and boys. The obligation to **protect**, means that the government must put laws and policies in place to prevent violations of human rights by non-government actors. For example, laws prohibiting domestic violence. The obligation to **fulfil**, means that the government must take positive steps to ensure that men and boys enjoy their rights in practice. This includes considering “factors that impede” men’s enjoyment of their rights and the removal of those obstacles.

## The need for identify state obligations to men and boys

Governments are more likely to protect and respect rights when human rights guidance and jurisprudence explicitly identify how to protect and respect those rights. 

The United Nations *Human Rights Committee* is responsible for receiving State reports on the ICCPR and issuing recommendations. The Committee has made thirty-seven General Comments on the interpretation of the ICCPR. General Comment 18 details State obligations under Article 2 (non-discrimination) and General Comment 28[^1] details State obligations under Article 3 (equal rights between men and women).

Although Article 3 of the ICCPR requires equal enjoyment of rights for both women and men, there is no official guidance with regards to men's rights. General Comment 28 focuses entirely on women. Paragraph 1 states:

> The Committee has decided to update its general comment on article 3 of the Covenant and to replace general comment No. 4 (thirteenth session, 1981), in the light of the experience it has gathered in its activities over the last 20 years. **The present revision seeks to take account of the important impact of this article on the enjoyment by women of the human rights protected under the Covenant.**

Similarly, the United Nations *Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights* has issued twenty-seven General Comments, including General Comment 16, which concerns Article 3 (equal rights between women and men) and General Comment 20, regarding Article 2 (non-discrimination). General Comment 16 focuses entirely on equal rights for women. General Comment 20 briefly recognisies that men may face discrimination; "Refusal to grant paternity leave may also amount to discrimination against men."[^60]

Additionally, States have a number of other instruments that provide comprehensive guidance on protecting and respecting the rights of women and girls. For example, the *Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women*, forty General Recommendations from the *Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women*, the *Beijing Declaration and Platform For Action*, the United Nations *Commission on the Status of Women*, and reports from the *Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women*.

Although, men and boys have the same human rights as women and girls, similar guidance for protecting and respecting men's rights is lacking. Commentators have argued that explicitly recognising men's rights is not necessary. For example,  Charlesworth[^2] argues that male over-representation in the development and administration of international human rights law means that human rights already accounts for men's rights by default. However, male representation has not lead to men's gender-specific human rights issues being addressed in a meaningful or substantive way. For example, Stemple[^3] points out there are no human rights instruments that explicitly address sexual violence against men, and Abramson[^4] says there is discrimination against boys in the children's rights movement.

Achieving equal enjoyment of rights between women and men requires thoroughly understanding women's and men's experiences of discrimination and inequality. Discrimination and inequality is not static, new forms can arise, so States need to continually monitor women's and men's human rights.[^5]

If States are to meet their obligations of equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex, it is necessary to explicitly identify States' obligations to men and boys.

## Government Obligations to men and boys

The *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* specifically recognises the rights of men and boys in Articles 2 and 3. Article 2 requires States to ensure all the rights to all individuals without discrimination based on sex, and Article 3 requires States to ensure equal enjoyment of rights for men and women.

### Which parts of government?

A state's obligations to men and boys involve all parts of the government and public authorities.

> All branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial), and other public or governmental authorities, at whatever level-national, regional or local-are in a position to engage the responsibility of the State Party.[^11]
## Take necessary steps

The ICCPR requires States to "take the necessary steps"[^16] to provide men their civil and political rights. This requirement is "unqualified and of immediate effect. A failure to comply with this obligation cannot be justified by reference to political, social, cultural or economic considerations within the State".[^17] Necessary steps include "legislative, judicial, administrative, educative and other appropriate measures."[^18]

Likewise, the ICESCR requires States to take steps "by all appropriate means" achieve men's full realisation of their economic, cultural and social rights.[^61] The ICESCR recognises that the  realisation of economic, cultural and social rights cannot happen all at once, and therefore allows for progressive realisation of these rights. However, "deliberate, concrete and targeted" steps must be taken to achieve men's equal enjoyment of the Covenant's rights.

### What steps are necessary?
#### Recognition of their obligations to men and boys
 If States are to meet their human rights obligations, they must recognise that this includes obligations to men and boys. 

Treating men's rights on equal terms with women's rights.



##### Equality

Equality is a fundamental principle of human rights. The *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* requires States to ensure men and women have equal enjoyment of their rights (Article 3), and that men are equal before the law and have equal protection of the law (Article 26).

Article 3 requires states to ensure men enjoy their rights in their totality and on and equal basis with women.[^6] States are required to "take all necessary steps"[^7] to ensure men enjoy all Covenant rights, and to "take account of the factors which impede"[^8] men's equal enjoyment of their rights.

Article 26 requires states to ensure men are equal before the law, and have equal protection of the law. States are required "to make such changes to domestic laws and practices as are necessary to ensure their conformity with the Covenant."[^9] requires equality before courts and tribunals. requires equal participation in public life.

### Non-discrimination

Non-discrimination is a fundamental principle of human rights which is incorporated into the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights*. For example, Article 2 requires States to ensure all the rights in the Covenant are recognised without distinction of any kind. Article 20 requires states to prohibit incitement to discrimination on racial or religious grounds. Article 26 prohibits discrimination and requires States to guarantee equal and effective protection against discrimination.

Although the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* does not define discrimination, the Human Rights Committee has clarified the meaning in General Comment 18:

> \[T\]he Committee believes that the term "discrimination" as used in the Covenant should be understood to imply any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference which is based on any ground such as race, colour, sex, \...and which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing, of all rights and freedoms.[^10]

The Covenant prohibits States from discriminating towards men, and requires States to protect men from discrimination.

Article 26 requires States' laws to guarantee that men have equal and effective protection against discrimination. It requires States to prohibit discrimination against men in law and in fact. This applies to all fields regulated and protected by public authorities. All legislation adopted by the State must not discriminate against men.[^12] If a State's laws do not align with the Covenant, the State must change its laws.[^13]

States are required to ensure equal protection for boys and girls[^14], and that children are free from discrimination.[^15]



### Ending discrimination against men

Ending discrimination against men in the public and private sector is a necessary step.[^19]

Ending discrimination requires analysis of laws and policies to identify any"distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference"[^20] that impairs men's enjoyment or exercise of their rights.

> "States parties should review their legislation and practices and take the lead in implementing all measures necessary to eliminate discrimination\... in all fields, for example by prohibiting discrimination by private actors in areas such as employment, education, political activities and the provision of accommodation, goods and services"[^21]

Gender analysis must be performed in a way that is *able to* and *effective at* detecting discrimination against men. If gender analysis reveals treatment that impairs the recognition men's rights, or men's enjoyment of their rights, "article 2 requires that the domestic law or practice be changed to meet the standards imposed by the Covenant's substantive guarantees."[^22] States may be able to justify differential treatment of men if it is reasonable, objective,[^23] necessary, proportionate, permissible under the Covenant, and intended to meet legitimate goals of the Covenant.[^24]

### Protecting men from discrimination

Article 26 requires State's laws "prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination". States are required to protect men from discrimination "in any field regulated and protected by public authorities",[^25] and by "public authorities, by the community, or by private persons or bodies".[^26]

A State's protection of men from discrimination must be "equal and effective".[^27]

Men must have the same legal protection from discrimination as women. In some situations protection is not equal, for example, equal pay legislation often does not protect men from pay discrimination. While historically pay discrimination exclusively affected women, the law must equally protect men from pay discrimination.

Protection mechanisms must be **effective** at protecting men from discrimination.
These are measures to protect women from discrimination that do not exist for men.

1.  Minister for women

2.  Ministry for women

3.  Women's equality strategy

4.  Women's health strategy

The application of protection mechanisms to prevent discrimination must be applied equally for men and women. Protection mechanisms intended to address all gender discrimination, such as gender analysis and gender budgeting, may not be applied equally. People charged with protecting men and women from discrimination must understand that it applies equally to men and women.

1.  Gender Budgeting -- only evaluated on impact on women, not men.

2.  Gender Analysis -- administered by Ministry for Women.

3.  BORA Section 7 -- not identifying discrimination against men in the law.

### Address discrimination against men

Not only must States refrain from discriminating against men, but States have a positive duty to guarantee men and boys have equal rights. For example requires States to ensure men have equal rights with regards to marriage, and at the dissolution of marriage. requires States to provide boys the same protection as girls, without discrimination.[^28]

> the positive obligations on States Parties to ensure Covenant rights will only be fully discharged if individuals are protected by the State, not just against violations of Covenant rights by its agents, but also against acts committed by private persons or entities that would impair the enjoyment of Covenant rights[^29]

States that permit discrimination against men or fail "to exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate or redress the harm" caused by discrimination against men, may be in breach of the Covenant.[^30]

States are also required to "take affirmative action in order to diminish or eliminate conditions which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination" against men. If there are conditions that impair men's enjoyment of their rights, States should act to correct those conditions. This may mean that, for a limited time, in specific matters, men may receive preferential treatment to correct for discrimination in fact.[^31]

#### remedy

> Article 2, paragraph 3, requires that in addition to effective protection of Covenant rights States Parties must ensure that individuals also have accessible and effective remedies to vindicate those rights\...
> Administrative mechanisms are particularly required to give effect to the general obligation to investigate allegations of violations promptly, thoroughly and effectively through independent and impartial bodies. National human rights institutions, endowed with appropriate powers, can contribute to this end. A failure by a State Party to investigate allegations of violations could in and of itself give rise to a separate breach of the Covenant. Cessation of an ongoing violation is an essential element of the right to an effective remedy.[^32]

##### Monitoring

the application of laws and policies is necessary to protect men from discrimination.

The Committee wants to know about discrimination *in fact*.

1.  Collecting sex disaggregated data (see CEDAW General recommendation 9)

##### Educating

State and non-State actors

1.  to ensure State actors understand and that measures that prohibit discrimination and ensure non-discrimination apply to men as well as women. ensure their actions reflect this.

##### Removal of obstacles

that impair men's enjoyment of their rights is necessary. "States parties should take account of the factors which impede the equal enjoyment by women and men of each right specified in the Covenant"[^33]

responding to complaints about discrimination and providing appropriate remedy

### Reporting discrimination

The Human Rights Committee asks States to include discrimination against men in their reports. The Committee wants to know about laws, polices and practices to protect against discrimination, as well as any discrimination against men in fact. Discrimination against men by public authorities, the community, or by private persons or bodies should be included in reports.[^34]

### Acting in good faith

> **General Comment 31, Paragraph 3:** Article 2 defines the scope of the legal obligations undertaken by States Parties to the Covenant. A general obligation is imposed on States Parties to respect the Covenant rights and to ensure them to all individuals in their territory and subject to their jurisdiction (see paragraph 10 below). Pursuant to the principle articulated in article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, States Parties are required to give effect to the obligations under the Covenant in **good faith**.

## The right to life

*International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* .1 "Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life."

### What is arbitrary?

> The notion of "arbitrariness" is not to be fully equated with "against the law", but must be interpreted more broadly to include elements of inappropriateness, injustice, lack of predictability and due process of law, as well as elements of reasonableness, necessity and proportionality.[^35]

### Equality

States must "ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment" of the right to life.[^36]

See: General Comment No. 28 for more on Article 3 requirements.

### Discrimination

States must respect and protect the right to life "without distinction of any kind".[^37] Deprivation of life based on discrimination is necessarily arbitrary in nature. Therefore, States must equally protect men's right to life and provide "effective guarantees against all forms of discrimination"[^38] that may lead to loss of life.

Discrimination, in this case, is "any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference"[^39] that impairs men's right to life.

## States' actions

State actors must not engage in actions that lead to premature deaths, or can reasonable be expected to lead to premature death.

This applies to all human-beings, so States must not cause premature deaths in other countries.

### Police use of force

Men make up the majority of people killed by Police, and who die in Police custody. "States parties are expected to take all necessary measures to prevent arbitrary deprivation of life by their law enforcement officials".[^40] States must minimise the risk to men who are in contact with the Police through adequate legislation, procedures, and training. States must provide suitable equipment to allow officers to use the minimum force necessary.

Police must not base decisions to use lethal force on sex or any other prohibited grounds for discrimination.

States must ensure the Police and other law enforcement agents respect men's right to life.

#### Police must take care

to ensure the welfare of men who they have arrested or detained. For example, by preventing suicides of men in custody.

#### Use of lethal force:

> The use of potentially lethal force for law enforcement purposes is an extreme measure that should be resorted to only when strictly necessary in order to protect life or prevent serious injury from an imminent threat. It cannot be used, for example, in order to prevent the escape from custody of a suspected criminal or a convict who does not pose a serious and imminent threat to the lives or bodily integrity of others. The intentional taking of life by any means is permissible only if it is strictly necessary in order to protect life from an imminent threat.[^41]

> States parties are expected to take all necessary measures to prevent arbitrary deprivation of life by their law enforcement officials, including soldiers charged with law enforcement missions. These measures include putting in place appropriate legislation controlling the use of lethal force by law enforcement officials, procedures designed to ensure that law enforcement actions are adequately planned in a manner consistent with the need to minimize the risk they pose to human life, mandatory reporting, review and investigation of lethal incidents and other life-threatening incidents, and supplying forces responsible for crowd control with effective, less-lethal means and adequate protective equipment in order to obviate their need to resort to lethal force (see also para. 14 below). In particular, all operations of law enforcement officials should comply with relevant international standards, including the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, and law enforcement officials should undergo appropriate training designed to inculcate these standards so as to ensure, in all circumstances, the fullest respect for the right to life.[^42]

### Deaths in prison or other detention (eg psychiatric wards)

### Death penalty

> .2 - In countries which have not abolished the death penalty, sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law in force at the
> time of the commission of the crime and not contrary to the provisions of the present
> Covenant and to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
> Genocide. This penalty can only be carried out pursuant to a final judgement rendered
> by a competent court.

> .4 - Anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon or commutation of the
> sentence. Amnesty, pardon or commutation of the sentence of death may be granted
> in all cases.
>
> .5 - Sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age and shall not be carried out on pregnant women.
>
> .6 - Nothing in this article shall be invoked to delay or to prevent the abolition of capital punishment by any State Party to the present Covenant.

### Military force

Such as declaring all fighting-age men as combatants.

Conscription. Male-only conscription puts men in danger while protecting women. This is a distinction based on sex, rather than ability.

### Genocide

### Androcide

## States' inaction

State inaction must not lead to premature deaths.

Inadequate public health measures

Deaths of Despair "The three disease types are drug overdose (including alcohol overdose), suicide, and alcoholic liver disease". - from Wikipedia Disease of despair

## Non-State actors

States must prevent non-state actors from causing premature death.

## General Conditions

States have an obligation to prevent premature deaths. They also have an obligation to ensure men have equal enjoyment of their rights. Men face more preventable deaths than women.

The right to life means that States must:

-   Not cause anyone's unnatural or premature death. State actions or inaction that might cause premature death:

-   Exercise due diligence to protect everyone from

    -   Unnatural or premature death.

    -   Things that are likely to cause unnatural or premature death

-   Address the general conditions of society that may lead to threats to life, such as

    -   Violence

    -   Accidents

    -   Substance abuse

    -   Homelessness

-   Ensure everyone has the basic requirements for life, such as food, water and shelter;

-   Improve the general conditions that support the right to life such as:

    -   Emergency services (e.g. Emergency medical care, firefighters, paramedics etc.)

-   Have plans to advance the right to life, such as:

    -   Fight stigmatisation of diseases and disability;

    -   Promote education for non-violence;

    -   Raise awareness of gender-based violence, and harmful practices.

-   Investigate violations fo the right to life in an independent,impartial, prompt, thorough, effective, credible and transparent manner.

-   "The right to life must be respected and ensured without distinction of any kind".[^43]

"The right to life is a right that should not be interpreted narrowly. It concerns the entitlement of individuals to be free from acts and omissions that are intended or may be expected to cause their unnatural or premature death, as well as to enjoy a life with dignity"[^44]

"Deprivation of life involves intentional or otherwise foreseeable and preventable life-terminating harm or injury, caused by an act or omission. It goes beyond injury to bodily or mental integrity or a threat thereto."[^45]

"The right to life must be respected and ensured without distinction of any kind".[^46]

States must respect men's right to life by adopting laws to prevent State and non-state actors from taking men's lives. States must also ensure men have their right to life in practice, by addressing the causes that lead to men's loss of life. For example, poor workplace safety, or inadequate health care systems.



## Loneliness

[Social Isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_isolation)

## Suicide

"States should take adequate measures, without violating their other Covenant obligations, to prevent suicides, especially among individuals in particularly vulnerable situations, including individuals deprived of their liberty"[^48]

Figure 1 shows self-harm deaths from 1948-2020.

## Homicide

Men are the majority of victims of homicide. Between 1950 and 2019 2040 men and 1197 women died from fatal assaults. Figure 2] shows 5-year fatal assaults.

## Marriage and family

.4 - States Parties to the present Covenant shall take appropriate steps to ensure equality of rights and responsibilities of spouses as to marriage, during marriage and at
its dissolution. In the case of dissolution, provision shall be made for the necessary protection of any children.

### General Comment 19

> During marriage, the spouses should have equal rights and responsibilities in the family. This equality extends to all matters arising from their relationship, such as choice of residence, running of the household, education of the children and administration of assets. Such equality continues to be applicable to arrangements regarding legal separation or dissolution of the marriage.[^49]

> Thus, **any discriminatory treatment in regard to the grounds and procedures for separation or divorce, child custody, maintenance or alimony, visiting rights or the loss or recovery of parental authority must be prohibited**, bearing in mind the paramount **interest of the children** in this connection. States parties should, in particular, include information in their reports concerning the provision made for the necessary protection of any children at the dissolution of a marriage or on the separation of the spouses.[^50]

### General Comment 17 

> \...If the marriage is dissolved, steps should be taken, keeping in view the paramount interest of the children, to give them necessary protection and, so far as is possible, to **guarantee personal relations with both parents**. \...[^51]

## Children's rights

States are required to adopt special measures to protect children. States must protect girls and boys equally[^52] and without discrimination.[^53]

Children are entitled to all of the civil and political rights in the Covenant.

The special measures to protect children in the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* are primarily about ensuring children have their civil and political rights. Additionally, this protection should extend to economic social and cultural measures.

> \...For example, *every possible economic and social measure should be taken* to reduce infant mortality and to eradicate malnutrition among children and **to prevent them from being subjected to acts of violence and cruel and inhuman treatment** or from being exploited by means of forced labour or prostitution, or by their use in the illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs, or by any other means. In the cultural field, every possible measure should be taken to foster the development of their personality and to **provide them with a level of education that will enable them to enjoy the rights recognized in the Covenant**, particularly the right to freedom of opinion and expression.[^54]

States must protect children from discrimination based on sex.[^55]

.1 - Every child shall have, without any discrimination as to \... sex, \... the right to such measures of **protection as are required by his status as a minor**, on the part of his family, society
and the State.

24.2 - Every child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have a name.

24.3 - Every child has the right to acquire a nationality.

> General Comment 28 -- p28. **The obligation of States parties to protect children (art. 24) should be carried out equally for boys and girls.** States parties should report on measures taken to ensure that girls are treated equally to boys *in education*, in feeding and in *health care*, and provide the Committee with disaggregated data in this respect. States parties should eradicate, both through legislation and any other appropriate measures, *all cultural or religious practices which jeopardize the freedom and well-being of female children*.[^56]

### General comment 17

> Article 24 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes the right of every child, without any discrimination, to receive from his family, society and the State the protection required by his status as a minor. **Consequently, the implementation of this provision entails the adoption of special measures to protect children**, in addition to the measures that States are required to take under article 2 **to ensure that everyone enjoys the rights provided for in the Covenant**. The reports submitted by States parties often seem to underestimate this obligation and supply inadequate information on the way in which **children are afforded enjoyment of their right to a special protection**.[^57]

### Circumcision

States must protect girls and boys equally. "States parties should eradicate, both through legislation and any other appropriate measures, *all cultural or religious practices which jeopardize the freedom and well-being of female children*."[^58]

This means that States should eradicate "all cultural or religious practices which jeopardize the freedom and well-being of *male* children."

Article 7
No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or
scientific experimentation

## Genital mutilation recognised as a violation of article 7

> General Comment 28 -- p11 -
> **To assess compliance with article 7 of the Covenant, as well as with article 24, which mandates special protection for children**, the Committee needs to be provided information on national laws and practice with regard to domestic and other types of violence against women, including rape. It also needs to know whether the State party gives access to safe abortion to women who have become pregnant as a result of rape. The States parties should also provide the Committee with information on measures to prevent forced abortion or forced sterilization. **In States parties where the practice of genital mutilation exists information on its extent and on measures to eliminate it should be provided**. The information provided by States parties on all these issues should include measures of protection, including legal remedies, for women whose rights under **article 7** have been violated.[^59]
