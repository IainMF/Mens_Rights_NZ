> [!tip] This page is a work in progress


A State's human rights obligations are divided into three broad categories. Respect, protect, and fulfil. The obligation to **respect**, means that the government must not violate the rights of men and boys. The obligation to **protect**, means that the government must put laws and policies in place to prevent violations of human rights by non-government actors. For example, laws prohibiting domestic violence. The obligation to **fulfil**, means that the government must take positive steps to ensure that men and boys enjoy their rights in practice.

> The obligation to fulfil further contains duties to provide, promote and facilitate. [^1]


## The need for identify state obligations to men and boys

Governments are more likely to protect and respect rights when human rights guidance and jurisprudence explicitly identify how to protect and respect those rights. 

The United Nations *Human Rights Committee* is responsible for receiving State reports on the ICCPR and issuing recommendations. The Committee has made thirty-seven General Comments on the interpretation of the ICCPR. General Comment 18 details State obligations under Article 2 (non-discrimination) and General Comment 28[^2] details State obligations under Article 3 (equal rights between men and women).

Although Article 3 of the ICCPR requires equal enjoyment of rights for both women and men, there is no official guidance with regards to men's rights. General Comment 28 focuses entirely on women. Paragraph 1 states:

> The Committee has decided to update its general comment on article 3 of the Covenant and to replace general comment No. 4 (thirteenth session, 1981), in the light of the experience it has gathered in its activities over the last 20 years. **The present revision seeks to take account of the important impact of this article on the enjoyment by women of the human rights protected under the Covenant.**

Similarly, the United Nations *Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights* has issued twenty-seven General Comments, including General Comment 16, which concerns Article 3 (equal rights between women and men) and General Comment 20, regarding Article 2 (non-discrimination). General Comment 16 focuses entirely on equal rights for women. General Comment 20 briefly recognisies that men may face discrimination; "Refusal to grant paternity leave may also amount to discrimination against men."[^3]

Additionally, States have a number of other instruments that provide comprehensive guidance on protecting and respecting the rights of women and girls. For example, the *Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women*, forty General Recommendations from the *Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women*, the *Beijing Declaration and Platform For Action*, the United Nations *Commission on the Status of Women*, and reports from the *Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women*.

Although, men and boys have the same human rights as women and girls, similar guidance for protecting and respecting men's rights is lacking. Commentators have argued that explicitly recognising men's rights is not necessary. For example,  Charlesworth[^4] argues that male over-representation in the development and administration of international human rights law means that human rights already accounts for men's rights by default. However, male representation has not lead to men's gender-specific human rights issues being addressed in a meaningful or substantive way. For example, Stemple[^5] points out there are no human rights instruments that explicitly address sexual violence against men, and Abramson[^6] says there is discrimination against boys in the children's rights movement.

Achieving equal enjoyment of rights between women and men requires thoroughly understanding women's and men's experiences of discrimination and inequality. Discrimination and inequality is not static, new forms can arise, so States need to continually monitor women's and men's human rights.[^7]

If States are to meet their obligations of equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex, it is necessary to explicitly identify States' obligations to men and boys.

## Government Obligations to men and boys

The *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* specifically recognises the rights of men and boys in Articles 2 and 3. Article 2 requires States to ensure all the rights to all individuals without discrimination based on sex, and Article 3 requires States to ensure equal enjoyment of rights for men and women.

 > The obligation to ensure to all individuals the rights recognized in the Covenant, established in articles 2 and 3 of the Covenant, requires that States parties **take all necessary steps to enable every person to enjoy those rights.**[^8] *Emphasis added*

Likewise, the *International Covenant on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights*, recognises the rights of men and boys in Articles 2 and 3. These articles require States to ensure both men and women enjoy their covenant rights equally  *in practice*.

> Article 2, paragraph 2, of ICESCR provides for a guarantee of non-discrimination on the basis of sex among other grounds.  This provision, and the guarantee of equal enjoyment of rights by men and women in article 3, are integrally related and mutually reinforcing... [^9]

> The essence of article 3 of ICESCR is that the rights set forth in the Covenant are to be enjoyed by men and women on a basis of equality, a concept that carries substantive meaning.  While expressions of formal equality may be found in constitutional provisions, legislation and policies of Governments, article 3 also mandates the equal enjoyment of the rights in the Covenant for men and women in practice. [^10]

>  Article 3 requires States to undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to enjoy the Covenant rights [^11]

> Article 3 sets **a non-derogable standard** for compliance with the obligations of States parties as set out in articles 6 through 15 of ICESCR [^12]


### Which parts of government?

A state's obligations to men and boys involve all parts of the government and public authorities.

> All branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial), and other public or governmental authorities, at whatever level-national, regional or local-are in a position to engage the responsibility of the State Party.[^13]


## Take necessary steps

The ICCPR requires States to "take the necessary steps"[^14] to provide men their civil and political rights. This requirement is "unqualified and of immediate effect. A failure to comply with this obligation cannot be justified by reference to political, social, cultural or economic considerations within the State".[^15] Necessary steps include "legislative, judicial, administrative, educative and other appropriate measures."[^16]

Likewise, the ICESCR requires States to take steps "by all appropriate means" achieve men's full realisation of their economic, cultural and social rights.[^17] The ICESCR recognises that the  realisation of economic, cultural and social rights cannot happen all at once, and therefore allows for progressive realisation of these rights. However, "deliberate, concrete and targeted" steps must be taken to achieve men's equal enjoyment of the Covenant's rights.

> The obligation to fulfil requires States parties **to take steps** to ensure that **in practice**, men and women enjoy their economic, social and cultural rights on a basis of equality. [^18]

#### Conduct and result
States have an obligation to behave (conduct themselves) in a way that promotes and supports human rights, as well as, an obligation to produce human rights results.
The obligation of conduct refers to 'taking steps'.

> Article 2 is of particular importance to a full understanding of the Covenant and must be seen as having a dynamic relationship with all of the other provisions of the Covenant. It describes the nature of the general legal obligations undertaken by States parties to the Covenant. Those obligations include both what may be termed (following the work of the International Law Commission) **obligations of conduct and obligations of result**. While great emphasis has sometimes been placed on the difference between the formulations used in this provision and that contained in the equivalent article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it is not always recognized that there are also significant similarities. In particular, while the Covenant provides for progressive realization and acknowledges the constraints due to the limits of available resources, it also imposes various obligations which are of immediate effect. Of these, two are of particular importance in understanding the precise nature of States parties obligations. One of these, which is dealt with in a separate general comment, and which is to be considered by the Committee at its sixth session, is the “undertaking to guarantee” that relevant rights “will be exercised without discrimination...”. [^19]

#### Progressive realistion
> The principal obligation of result reflected in article 2 (1) is to take steps “with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized” in the Covenant. The  term  “progressive  realization”  is  often  used  to  describe  the  intent  of this  phrase. The  concept  of  progressive  realization  constitutes  a  recognition  of  the fact  that  full  realization  of  all  economic,  social  and  cultural  rights  will  generally  not be  able  to  be  achieved  in  a  short  period  of  time. ... Nevertheless, the fact that realization over time, or in other words progressively, is foreseen under the Covenant should not be misinterpreted as depriving the obligation of all meaningful content. It is on the one hand a necessary flexibility device, reflecting the realities of the real world and the difficulties involved for any country in ensuring full realization of economic, social and cultural rights. On the other hand, the phrase must be read in the light of the overall objective, indeed the raison d’être, of the Covenant which is to establish clear obligations for States parties in respect of the full realization of the rights in question. It thus imposes **an obligation to move as expeditiously and effectively as possible towards that goal**.[^20]

### Specific obligations
Article 3 of both the ICCPR and ICESCR require States to ensure equal enjoyment of rights for men and for women.

> Article 3 implies that all human beings should enjoy the rights provided for in the Covenant, on an equal basis and in their totality.  The full effect of this provision is impaired whenever any person is denied the full and equal enjoyment of any right.  Consequently, States should ensure to men and women equally the enjoyment of all rights provided for in the Covenant.[^21]

> States parties are responsible for ensuring the equal enjoyment of rights without any discrimination.  Articles 2 and 3 mandate States parties to take all steps necessary, including the prohibition of discrimination on the ground of sex, to put an end to discriminatory actions, both in the public and the private sector, which impair the equal enjoyment of rights.[^22]

### Acting in good faith

> **General Comment 31, Paragraph 3:** Article 2 defines the scope of the legal obligations undertaken by States Parties to the Covenant. A general obligation is imposed on States Parties to respect the Covenant rights and to ensure them to all individuals in their territory and subject to their jurisdiction (see paragraph 10 below). Pursuant to the principle articulated in article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, States Parties are required to give effect to the obligations under the Covenant in **good faith**.

### What steps are necessary?
#### Recognition of their obligations to men and boys
 If States are to meet their human rights obligations, they must recognise that this includes obligations to men and boys. 

Treating men's rights on equal terms with women's rights.


> These steps include the **removal of obstacles** to the equal enjoyment of such rights, the **education of the population and of State officials in human rights**, and the **adjustment of domestic legislation** so as to give effect to the undertakings set forth in the Covenant.  The State party must not only adopt measures of protection, but also **positive measures** in all areas so as to achieve the effective and equal empowerment of women.  States parties must **provide information** regarding the actual role of women in society so that the Committee may ascertain what measures, in addition to legislative provisions, have been or should be taken to give effect to these obligations, what progress has been made, what difficulties are encountered and what steps are being taken to overcome them.[^23]

> States parties are responsible for ensuring the equal enjoyment of rights without any discrimination.  Articles 2 and 3 mandate States parties to take all steps necessary, including the **prohibition of discrimination** on the ground of sex, to put an **end to discriminatory actions**, both in the public and the private sector, which impair the equal enjoyment of rights.[^24]

> States parties should **ensure that traditional, historical, religious or cultural attitudes are not used to justify violations** of women’s right to equality before the law and to equal enjoyment of all Covenant rights. States parties should **furnish appropriate information on those aspects of tradition, history, cultural practices and religious attitudes which jeopardize, or may jeopardize, compliance with article 3**, and indicate what measures they have taken or intend to take to overcome such factors. [^25] 

#### Removal of obstacles
> These steps include the **removal of obstacles** to the equal enjoyment of such rights[^26]

> The implementation of article 3, in relation to article 12, requires at a minimum the **removal of legal and other obstacles that prevent men and women from accessing and benefiting from health care on a basis of equality**.  This includes, inter alia, addressing the ways in which gender roles affect access to determinants of health, such as water and food; the removal of legal restrictions on reproductive health provisions; the prohibition of female genital mutilation; and the provision of adequate training for health-care workers to deal with women’s health issues.[^27] 

##### Factors which impede
> In order to fulfil the obligation set forth in article 3, States parties should take account of the factors which impede the equal enjoyment by women and men of each right specified in the Covenant.[^28]  

##### Stereotypes

> 19.	The obligation to protect requires States parties to take steps aimed directly at the **elimination of prejudices**, customary and all other practices that perpetuate the notion of inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes, and stereotyped roles for men and women.[^29]

> 22.	Article 3 is a cross-cutting obligation and applies to all the rights contained in articles 6 to 15 of the Covenant.  It requires **addressing gender-based social and cultural prejudices**, providing for **equality in the allocation of resources**, and promoting the sharing of responsibilities in the family, community and public life.[^30]

> Since the adoption of the Covenant, the notion of the prohibited ground “sex” has evolved considerably to cover not only physiological characteristics but also the social construction of **gender stereotypes, prejudices and expected roles**, which have **created obstacles** to the equal fulfilment of economic, social and cultural rights. Thus, the refusal to hire a woman, on the ground that she might become pregnant, or the allocation of low-level or part‑time jobs to women based on the stereotypical assumption that, for example, they are unwilling to commit as much time to their work as men, constitutes discrimination. Refusal to grant paternity leave may also amount to discrimination against men.[^31]

> The obligation to protect requires States parties to take steps aimed directly at the elimination of prejudices, customary and all other practices that perpetuate the notion of inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes, and stereotyped roles for men and women.[^32]


#### Education
>  These steps include ... the **education of the population and of State officials in human rights**[^33]

> - To conduct human rights education and training programmes for judges and public officials 
> - To conduct awareness-raising and training programmes on equality for workers involved in the realization of economic, social and cultural rights at the grass-roots level
> -To integrate, in formal and non-formal education, the principle of the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, and to promote equal participation of men and women, boys and girls, in schools and other education programmes[^34]

> ... States parties should ensure, in particular through information and awareness-raising campaigns, that families desist from giving preferential treatment to boys when sending their children to school, and **that curricula promote equality and non-discrimination**.[^35]

> the State should conduct human rights education and training programmes for public officials and make such training available to judges and candidates for judicial appointments. Teaching on the principles of equality and non discrimination should be integrated in formal and non-formal inclusive and multicultural education, with a view to dismantling notions of superiority or inferiority based on prohibited grounds and to promote dialogue and tolerance between different groups in society[^36]



#### Adjusting legislation and policy

> These steps include ... the **adjustment of domestic legislation** so as to give effect to the undertakings set forth in the Covenant.[^37]

> 31. ... Laws which impose more severe penalties on women than on men for adultery or other offences also violate the requirement of equal treatment. ... States parties should review their legislation and practices and take the lead in implementing all measures necessary to eliminate discrimination against women in all fields, for example by prohibiting discrimination by private actors in areas such as employment, education, political activities and the provision of accommodation, goods and services.  States parties should report on all these measures and provide information on the remedies available to victims of such discrimination.

> .  Respecting the right obliges States parties **not to adopt, and to repeal laws and rescind, policies, administrative measures and programmes that do not conform with the right protected by article 3**.  In particular, it is incumbent upon States parties to **take into account the effect of apparently gender-neutral laws, policies and programmes** and to consider whether they could result in a negative impact on the ability of men and women to enjoy their human rights on a basis of equality.[^38]

> 34.	States parties should periodically **review existing legislation, policies, strategies and programmes** in relation to economic, social and cultural rights, and adopt any necessary changes to ensure that they are consonant with their obligations under article 3 of the Covenant.[^39]

> ... Failure to **adopt, implement and monitor effects of laws, policies and programmes** to eliminate de jure  and de facto discrimination with respect to each of the rights enumerated in articles 6 to 15 of the Covenant constitutes a violation of those rights.[^40]

> Other **laws should be regularly reviewed** and, where necessary, amended in order to ensure that they do not discriminate **or lead to discrimination**, whether formally or substantively, in relation to the exercise and enjoyment of Covenant rights.[^41]



#### Positive measures
>  The State party must not only adopt measures of protection, but also **positive measures** in all areas so as to achieve the effective and equal empowerment of women.[^42]

> The Committee also wishes to point out that the **principle of equality sometimes requires States parties to take affirmative action in order to diminish or eliminate conditions which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination prohibited by the Covenant**. For example, in a State where the general conditions of a certain part of the population prevent or impair their enjoyment of human rights, the State should take specific action to correct those conditions. Such action may involve granting for a time to the part of the population concerned certain preferential treatment in specific matters as compared with the rest of the population. However, as long as such action is needed to correct discrimination in fact, it is a case of legitimate differentiation under the Covenant.[^43]

> The principles of equality and non-discrimination, by themselves, are not always sufficient to guarantee true equality.  Temporary special measures may sometimes be needed in order to bring disadvantaged or marginalized persons or groups of persons to the same substantive level as others.  Temporary special measures aim at realizing not only de jure or formal equality, but also de facto or substantive equality for men and women.  However, the application of the principle of equality will sometimes require that States parties take measures in favour of women in order to attenuate or suppress conditions that perpetuate discrimination.  As long as these measures are necessary to redress de facto discrimination and are terminated when de facto equality is achieved, such differentiation is legitimate.[^44]

> To design and implement policies and programmes to give long-term effect to the economic, social and cultural rights of both men and women on the basis of equality.  These may include the adoption of temporary special measures to accelerate women’s equal enjoyment of their rights, gender audits, and gender-specific allocation of resources;[^45]

> The adoption of temporary special measures may be necessary to accelerate the equal enjoyment by women of all economic, social and cultural rights and to improve the de facto position of women.  Temporary special measures should be distinguished from permanent policies and strategies undertaken to achieve equality of men and women.[^46]

> States parties are **encouraged to adopt temporary special measures to accelerate the achievement of equality between men and women in the enjoyment of the rights under the Covenant**.  Such measures are not to be considered discriminatory in themselves as they are grounded in the State’s obligation to **eliminate disadvantage caused by past and current discriminatory laws, traditions and practices**.  The nature, duration and application of such measures should be designed with reference to the specific issue and context, and should be adjusted as circumstances require.  The results of such measures should be monitored with a view to being discontinued when the objectives for which they are undertaken have been achieved.[^47]

#### Monitoring and Reporting

> To develop monitoring mechanisms to ensure that the implementation of laws and policies aimed at promoting the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by men and women do not have unintended adverse effects on disadvantaged or marginalized individuals or groups, particularly women and girls[^48]


> States parties must **provide information** regarding the actual role of women in society so that the Committee may ascertain what measures, in addition to legislative provisions, have been or should be taken to give effect to these obligations, what progress has been made, what difficulties are encountered and what steps are being taken to overcome them.[^49]

>  These strategies should be based on the **systematic identification of policies, programmes and activities** relevant to the situation and context within the State, as derived from the **normative content of article 3** of the Covenant and spelled out in relation to the levels and nature of States parties’ obligations referred to in paragraphs 16 to 21 above.  The strategies should give particular attention to the **elimination of discrimination** in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.[^50]

> States parties should periodically **review existing legislation, policies, strategies and programmes** in relation to economic, social and cultural rights, and adopt any necessary changes to ensure that they are consonant with their obligations under article 3 of the Covenant.[^51]

> National policies and strategies should identify appropriate indicators and benchmarks on the right to equal enjoyment by men and women of economic, social and cultural rights in order to effectively monitor the implementation by the State party of its obligations under the Covenant in this regard.  Disaggregated statistics, provided within specific time frames, are necessary to measure the progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights by men and women, where appropriate.[^52]

> ... Failure to adopt, implement and **monitor** effects of laws, policies and programmes to eliminate de jure  and de facto discrimination with respect to each of the rights enumerated in articles 6 to 15 of the Covenant constitutes a violation of those rights.[^53]

> States parties are **obliged to monitor effectively the implementation of measures to comply with article 2, paragraph 2**, of the Covenant. Monitoring should assess both the steps taken and the results achieved in the elimination of discrimination. National strategies, policies and plans should use **appropriate indicators** and benchmarks, disaggregated on the basis of the prohibited grounds of discrimination[^54]

See **guidelines for reporting on CCPR** regarding requirement to report on article 3

See CCPR General Comment No. 28 for reporting requirements

##### Reporting discrimination

The Human Rights Committee asks States to include discrimination against men in their reports. The Committee wants to know about laws, polices and practices to protect against discrimination, as well as any discrimination against men *in fact*. Discrimination against men by public authorities, the community, or by private persons or bodies should be included in reports.[^55]


#### Ensure traditional or cultural attitudes are not used as justifications to violate men's rights

#### Ensure marriage equality
> States are required to treat men and women equally in regard to marriage in accordance with article 23, which has been elaborated further by general comment No. 19 (1990).  Men and women have the right to enter into marriage only with their free and full consent, and States have an obligation to protect the enjoyment of this right on an equal basis.[^56] 

> To fulfil their obligations under article 23, paragraph 4, States parties must **ensure that the matrimonial regime contains equal rights and obligations for both spouses with regard to the custody and care of children**, the children’s religious and moral education, the capacity to transmit to children the parent’s nationality, and the ownership or administration of property, whether common property or property in the sole ownership of either spouse.[^57] 

> Such steps may take the form of legislative, administrative or other measures, but it is a **positive duty** of States parties to **make certain that spouses have equal rights as required by the Covenant**.[^58]

> Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Covenant requires that States parties recognize that the widest possible protection and assistance should be accorded to the family, and that marriage must be entered into with the free consent of the intending spouses.  Implementing article 3, in relation to article 10, requires States parties, inter alia, to provide victims of domestic violence, who are primarily female, with access to safe housing, remedies and redress for physical, mental and emotional damage; to ensure that men and women have an equal right to choose if, whom and when to marry - in particular, the legal age of marriage for men and women should be the same, and boys and girls should be protected equally from practices that promote child marriage, marriage by proxy, or coercion; and to ensure that women have equal rights to marital property and inheritance upon their husband’s death.  Gender-based violence is a form of discrimination that inhibits the ability to enjoy rights and freedoms, including economic, social and cultural rights, on a basis of equality.  States parties must take appropriate measures to eliminate violence against men and women and act with due diligence to prevent, investigate, mediate, punish and redress acts of violence against them by private actors.[^59]

##### Marriage and family

.4 - States Parties to the present Covenant shall take appropriate steps to ensure equality of rights and responsibilities of spouses as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. In the case of dissolution, provision shall be made for the necessary protection of any children.

> Finally, the State party should reduce the constraints faced by men and women in reconciling professional and family responsibilities by promoting adequate policies for childcare and care of dependent family member[^60]

> ... paternity leave for men[^61]

###### General Comment 19

> During marriage, the spouses should have equal rights and responsibilities in the family. This equality extends to all matters arising from their relationship, such as choice of residence, running of the household, education of the children and administration of assets. Such equality continues to be applicable to arrangements regarding legal separation or dissolution of the marriage.[^62]

> Thus, **any discriminatory treatment in regard to the grounds and procedures for separation or divorce, child custody, maintenance or alimony, visiting rights or the loss or recovery of parental authority must be prohibited**, bearing in mind the paramount **interest of the children** in this connection. States parties should, in particular, include information in their reports concerning the provision made for the necessary protection of any children at the dissolution of a marriage or on the separation of the spouses.[^63]

##### General Comment 17 

> \...If the marriage is dissolved, steps should be taken, keeping in view the paramount interest of the children, to give them necessary protection and, so far as is possible, to **guarantee personal relations with both parents**. \...[^64]

#### Equal protection of boys
> The obligation of States parties to protect children (art. 24) should be carried out equally for boys and girls.  States parties should report on measures taken to ensure that girls are treated equally to boys in education, in feeding and in health care, and provide the Committee with disaggregated data in this respect.  States parties should eradicate, both through legislation and any other appropriate measures, all cultural or religious practices which jeopardize the freedom and well-being of female children.[^65]

> In relation to children, article 24 provides that all children, **without any discrimination** as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, national or social origin, property or birth, have the right to such measures of **protection as are required by their status as minors**, on the part of their family, society and the State.[^66]




##### Children's rights

States are required to adopt special measures to protect children. States must protect girls and boys equally[^67] and without discrimination.[^68]

Children are entitled to all of the civil and political rights in the Covenant.

The special measures to protect children in the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* are primarily about ensuring children have their civil and political rights. Additionally, this protection should extend to economic social and cultural measures.

> \...For example, *every possible economic and social measure should be taken* to reduce infant mortality and to eradicate malnutrition among children and **to prevent them from being subjected to acts of violence and cruel and inhuman treatment** or from being exploited by means of forced labour or prostitution, or by their use in the illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs, or by any other means. In the cultural field, every possible measure should be taken to foster the development of their personality and to **provide them with a level of education that will enable them to enjoy the rights recognized in the Covenant**, particularly the right to freedom of opinion and expression.[^69]

States must protect children from discrimination based on sex.[^70]

.1 - Every child shall have, without any discrimination as to \... sex, \... the right to such measures of **protection as are required by his status as a minor**, on the part of his family, society and the State.

24.2 - Every child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have a name.

24.3 - Every child has the right to acquire a nationality.

> General Comment 28 -- para. 28. **The obligation of States parties to protect children (art. 24) should be carried out equally for boys and girls.** States parties should report on measures taken to ensure that girls are treated equally to boys *in education*, in feeding and in *health care*, and provide the Committee with disaggregated data in this respect. States parties should eradicate, both through legislation and any other appropriate measures, *all cultural or religious practices which jeopardize the freedom and well-being of female children*.[^71]

##### General comment 17

> Article 24 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes the right of every child, without any discrimination, to receive from his family, society and the State the protection required by his status as a minor. **Consequently, the implementation of this provision entails the adoption of special measures to protect children**, in addition to the measures that States are required to take under article 2 **to ensure that everyone enjoys the rights provided for in the Covenant**. The reports submitted by States parties often seem to underestimate this obligation and supply inadequate information on the way in which **children are afforded enjoyment of their right to a special protection**.[^72]

##### Circumcision

States must protect girls and boys equally. "States parties should eradicate, both through legislation and any other appropriate measures, *all cultural or religious practices which jeopardize the freedom and well-being of female children*."[^73]

This means that States should eradicate "all cultural or religious practices which jeopardize the freedom and well-being of *male* children."

Article 7
No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or
scientific experimentation

##### Genital mutilation recognised as a violation of article 7

> General Comment 28 -- para. 11 -
> **To assess compliance with article 7 of the Covenant, as well as with article 24, which mandates special protection for children**, the Committee needs to be provided information on national laws and practice with regard to domestic and other types of violence against women, including rape. It also needs to know whether the State party gives access to safe abortion to women who have become pregnant as a result of rape. The States parties should also provide the Committee with information on measures to prevent forced abortion or forced sterilization. **In States parties where the practice of genital mutilation exists information on its extent and on measures to eliminate it should be provided**. The information provided by States parties on all these issues should include measures of protection, including legal remedies, for women whose rights under **article 7** have been violated.[^74]

#### Protection from discrimination
> 31.	The right to equality before the law and freedom from discrimination, protected by article 26, requires States to act against discrimination by public and private agencies in all fields.

> While article 2 limits the scope of the rights to be protected against discrimination to those provided for in the Covenant, article 26 does not specify such limitations. That is to say, article 26 provides that **all persons are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the law without discrimination**, and that the law shall **guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination** on any of the enumerated grounds. In the view of the Committee, article 26 does not merely duplicate the guarantee already provided for in article 2 but provides in itself an autonomous right. It prohibits discrimination in law or in fact in any field regulated and protected by public authorities. Article 26 is therefore concerned with the obligations imposed on States parties in regard to their legislation and the application thereof. **Thus, when legislation is adopted by a State party, it must comply with the requirement of article 26 that its content should not be discriminatory.** In other words, the application of the principle of non discrimination contained in article 26 is not limited to those rights which are provided for in the Covenant.[^75]

> Article 2, paragraph 2, of ICESCR provides for a guarantee of non-discrimination on the basis of sex among other grounds.  This provision, and the guarantee of equal enjoyment of rights by men and women in article 3, are integrally related and mutually reinforcing.  Moreover, **the elimination of discrimination is fundamental to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights on a basis of equality**.[^76]

> States parties have an obligation to monitor and regulate the conduct of non-State actors to ensure that they do not violate the equal right of men and women to enjoy economic, social and cultural rights.  This obligation applies, for example, in cases where public services have been partially or fully privatized.[^77]

> Adoption of legislation to address discrimination is indispensable in complying with article 2, paragraph 2. States parties are therefore encouraged to adopt specific legislation that prohibits discrimination in the field of economic, social and cultural rights. Such laws should aim at eliminating formal and substantive discrimination, attribute obligations to public and private actors and cover the prohibited grounds discussed above.[^78]

> States parties should also adopt appropriate **preventive measures to avoid the emergence of new marginalized groups**.[^79]

##### Equality

Equality is a fundamental principle of human rights. The *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* requires States to ensure men and women have equal enjoyment of their rights (Article 3), and that men are equal before the law and have equal protection of the law (Article 26).

Article 3 requires states to ensure men enjoy their rights in their totality and on and equal basis with women.[^80] States are required to "take all necessary steps"[^81] to ensure men enjoy all Covenant rights, and to "take account of the factors which impede"[^82] men's equal enjoyment of their rights.

Article 26 requires states to ensure men are equal before the law, and have equal protection of the law. States are required "to make such changes to domestic laws and practices as are necessary to ensure their conformity with the Covenant."[^83] requires equality before courts and tribunals. requires equal participation in public life.
#### Representation in decision making
> To promote equal participation of men and women in development planning, decision-making and in the benefits of development and all programmes related to the realization of economic, social and cultural rights.[^84]
> 
> The right of individuals and groups of individuals to participate in decision-making processes that may affect their development must be an integral component of any policy, programme or activity developed to discharge governmental obligations under article 3 of the Covenant.[^85]


#### Remedy
> - To make available and accessible appropriate remedies, such as compensation, reparation, restitution, rehabilitation, guarantees of non-repetition, declarations, public apologies, educational programmes and prevention programmes. 
> - To establish appropriate venues for redress such as courts and tribunals or administrative mechanisms that are accessible to all on the basis of equality, including the poorest and most disadvantaged and marginalized  men and women;[^86]

> National policies and strategies should provide for the establishment of effective mechanisms and institutions where they do not exist, including administrative authorities, ombudsmen and other national human rights institutions, courts and tribunals.  These institutions should **investigate and address alleged violations relating to article 3** and provide remedies for such violations.  States parties, for their part, should ensure that such remedies are effectively implemented.[^87]

> National legislation, strategies, policies and plans should provide for mechanisms and institutions that effectively address the individual and structural nature of the harm caused by discrimination in the field of economic, social and cultural rights. ... These institutions should also be empowered to provide effective remedies, such as compensation, reparation, restitution, rehabilitation, guarantees of non-repetition and public apologies, and State parties should ensure that these measures are effectively implemented Domestic legal guarantees of equality and non-discrimination should be interpreted by these institutions in ways which facilitate and promote the full protection of economic, social and cultural rights.[^88]

> Among the measures which might be considered appropriate, in addition to legislation, is the provision of judicial remedies with respect to rights which may, in accordance with the national legal system, be considered justiciable. The Committee notes, for example, that the enjoyment of the rights recognized, without discrimination, will often be appropriately promoted, in part, through the provision of judicial or other effective remedies. Indeed, those States parties which are also parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are already obligated (by virtue of articles 2 (paras. 1 and 3), 3 and 26) of that Covenant to ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms (including the right to equality and non-discrimination) recognized in that Covenant are violated, “shall have an effective remedy” (art. 2 (3) (a)). In addition, there are a number of other provisions in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, including articles 3, 7 (a) (i), 8, 10 (3), 13 (2) (a), (3) and (4) and 15 (3) which would seem to be capable of immediate application by judicial and other organs in many national legal systems. Any suggestion that the provisions indicated are inherently non-self-executing would seem to be difficult to sustain.[^89]

#### Address violence

> Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Covenant requires that States parties recognize that the widest possible protection and assistance should be accorded to the family, and that marriage must be entered into with the free consent of the intending spouses.  Implementing article 3, in relation to article 10, requires States parties, inter alia, **to provide victims of domestic violence, who are primarily female, with access to safe housing, remedies and redress for physical, mental and emotional damage**; to ensure that men and women have an equal right to choose if, whom and when to marry - in particular, the legal age of marriage for men and women should be the same, and **boys and girls should be protected equally from practices that promote child marriage**, marriage by proxy, or coercion; and to ensure that women have equal rights to marital property and inheritance upon their husband’s death.  **Gender-based violence is a form of discrimination that inhibits the ability to enjoy rights and freedoms, including economic, social and cultural rights, on a basis of equality**.  States parties **must take appropriate measures to eliminate violence against men and women** and act with **due diligence** to prevent, investigate, mediate, punish and redress acts of violence against them by private actors.[^90]

#### National Plan of Action

> ... Among other things, States parties must, integrate into national plans of action for human rights **appropriate strategies to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights**[^91]
>  These strategies should be based on the **systematic identification of policies, programmes and activities** relevant to the situation and context within the State, as derived from the **normative content of article 3** of the Covenant and spelled out in relation to the levels and nature of States parties’ obligations referred to in paragraphs 16 to 21 above.  The strategies should give particular attention to the **elimination of discrimination** in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.[^92]


> States parties should ensure that strategies, policies, and plans of action are in place and implemented in order to address both formal and substantive discrimination by public and  
private actors in the area of Covenant rights. Such policies, plans and strategies should address all groups distinguished by the prohibited grounds and States parties are encouraged, among other possible steps, to adopt temporary special measures in order to accelerate the achievement of equality.[^93]

> National strategies, policies and plans should use **appropriate indicators** and benchmarks, disaggregated on the basis of the prohibited grounds of discrimination[^94]

#### No Retrogression
> The adoption and undertaking of any retrogressive measures that affect the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of the all the rights set forth in the Covenant constitutes a violation of article 3.[^95]

> Moreover, any deliberately retrogressive measures in that regard would require the most careful consideration and would need to be fully justified by reference to the totality of the rights provided for in the Covenant and in the context of the full use of the maximum available resources.[^96]
> 


### Non-discrimination

Non-discrimination is a fundamental principle of human rights which is incorporated into the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights*. For example, Article 2 requires States to ensure all the rights in the Covenant are recognised without distinction of any kind. Article 20 requires states to prohibit incitement to discrimination on racial or religious grounds. Article 26 prohibits discrimination and requires States to guarantee equal and effective protection against discrimination.

Although the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* does not define discrimination, the Human Rights Committee has clarified the meaning in General Comment 18:

> \[T\]he Committee believes that the term "discrimination" as used in the Covenant should be understood to imply any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference which is based on any ground such as race, colour, sex, \...and which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing, of all rights and freedoms.[^97]

The Covenant prohibits States from discriminating towards men, and requires States to protect men from discrimination.

Article 26 requires States' laws to guarantee that men have equal and effective protection against discrimination. It requires States to prohibit discrimination against men in law and in fact. This applies to all fields regulated and protected by public authorities. All legislation adopted by the State must not discriminate against men.[^98] If a State's laws do not align with the Covenant, the State must change its laws.[^99]

States are required to ensure equal protection for boys and girls[^100], and that children are free from discrimination.[^101]



### Ending discrimination against men

Ending discrimination against men in the public and private sector is a necessary step.[^102]

Ending discrimination requires analysis of laws and policies to identify any "distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference"[^103] that impairs men's enjoyment or exercise of their rights.

> "States parties should review their legislation and practices and take the lead in implementing all measures necessary to eliminate discrimination\... in all fields, for example by prohibiting discrimination by private actors in areas such as employment, education, political activities and the provision of accommodation, goods and services"[^104]



Gender analysis must be performed in a way that is *able to* and *effective at* detecting discrimination against men. If gender analysis reveals treatment that impairs the recognition men's rights, or men's enjoyment of their rights, "article 2 requires that the domestic law or practice be changed to meet the standards imposed by the Covenant's substantive guarantees."[^105] States may be able to justify differential treatment of men if it is reasonable, objective,[^106] necessary, proportionate, permissible under the Covenant, and intended to meet legitimate goals of the Covenant.[^107]

#### Systemic discrimination
>  States parties must adopt an **active approach** to eliminating **systemic discrimination** and segregation in practice. Tackling such discrimination will usually require a comprehensive approach with a range of laws, policies and programmes, including temporary special measures. States parties should consider using incentives to encourage public and private actors to **change their attitudes and behaviour in relation to individuals and groups of individuals facing systemic discrimination**, or penalize them in case of non-compliance. Public leadership and programmes to raise awareness about systemic discrimination and the adoption of strict measures against incitement to discrimination are often necessary. Eliminating systemic discrimination will frequently require devoting greater resources to traditionally neglected groups. Given the **persistent hostility towards some groups**, particular attention will need to be given to ensuring that laws and policies are **implemented by officials** and others in practice.[^108]

##### Promote
>  In the present general comment, the obligation to fulfil also incorporates an obligation to **promote the elimination of all forms of discrimination** against women[^109]

### Protecting men from discrimination

> 20.	States parties have an obligation to **monitor and regulate the conduct of non-State actors** to ensure that they do not violate the equal right of men and women to enjoy economic, social and cultural rights.  This obligation applies, for example, in cases where public services have been partially or fully privatized[^110]


Article 26 requires State's laws "prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination". States are required to protect men from discrimination "in any field regulated and protected by public authorities",[^111] and by "public authorities, by the community, or by private persons or bodies".[^112]

A State's protection of men from discrimination must be "equal and effective".[^113]

Men must have the same legal protection from discrimination as women. In some situations protection is not equal, for example, equal pay legislation often does not protect men from pay discrimination. While historically pay discrimination exclusively affected women, the law must equally protect men from pay discrimination.

Protection mechanisms must be **effective** at protecting men from discrimination.
These are measures to protect women from discrimination that do not exist for men.

1.  Minister for women

2.  Ministry for women

3.  Women's equality strategy

4.  Women's health strategy

The application of protection mechanisms to prevent discrimination must be applied equally for men and women. Protection mechanisms intended to address all gender discrimination, such as gender analysis and gender budgeting, may not be applied equally. People charged with protecting men and women from discrimination must understand that it applies equally to men and women.

1.  Gender Budgeting -- only evaluated on impact on women, not men.

2.  Gender Analysis -- administered by Ministry for Women.

3.  BORA Section 7 -- not identifying discrimination against men in the law.

### Address discrimination against men

Not only must States refrain from discriminating against men, but States have a positive duty to guarantee men and boys have equal rights. For example requires States to ensure men have equal rights with regards to marriage, and at the dissolution of marriage. requires States to provide boys the same protection as girls, without discrimination.[^114]

> the positive obligations on States Parties to ensure Covenant rights will only be fully discharged if individuals are protected by the State, not just against violations of Covenant rights by its agents, but also against acts committed by private persons or entities that would impair the enjoyment of Covenant rights[^115]

States that permit discrimination against men or fail "to exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate or redress the harm" caused by discrimination against men, may be in breach of the Covenant.[^116]

States are also required to "take affirmative action in order to diminish or eliminate conditions which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination" against men. If there are conditions that impair men's enjoyment of their rights, States should act to correct those conditions. This may mean that, for a limited time, in specific matters, men may receive preferential treatment to correct for discrimination in fact.[^117]

#### remedy

> Article 2, paragraph 3, requires that in addition to effective protection of Covenant rights States Parties must ensure that individuals also have accessible and effective remedies to vindicate those rights\...
> Administrative mechanisms are particularly required to give effect to the general obligation to investigate allegations of violations promptly, thoroughly and effectively through independent and impartial bodies. National human rights institutions, endowed with appropriate powers, can contribute to this end. A failure by a State Party to investigate allegations of violations could in and of itself give rise to a separate breach of the Covenant. Cessation of an ongoing violation is an essential element of the right to an effective remedy.[^118]

##### Monitoring

the application of laws and policies is necessary to protect men from discrimination.

The Committee wants to know about discrimination *in fact*.
