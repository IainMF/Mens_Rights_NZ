> [!tip] This page is a work in progress


A State's human rights obligations are divided into three broad categories. Respect, protect, and fulfil. The obligation to **respect**, means that the government must not violate the rights of men and boys. The obligation to **protect**, means that the government must put laws and policies in place to prevent violations of human rights by non-government actors. For example, laws prohibiting domestic violence. The obligation to **fulfil**, means that the government must take positive steps to ensure that men and boys enjoy their rights in practice. This includes considering “factors that impede” men’s enjoyment of their rights and the removal of those obstacles.

## The need for identify state obligations to men and boys

Governments are more likely to protect and respect rights when human rights guidance and jurisprudence explicitly identify how to protect and respect those rights. 

The United Nations *Human Rights Committee* is responsible for receiving State reports on the ICCPR and issuing recommendations. The Committee has made thirty-seven General Comments on the interpretation of the ICCPR. General Comment 18 details State obligations under Article 2 (non-discrimination) and General Comment 28[^1] details State obligations under Article 3 (equal rights between men and women).

Although Article 3 of the ICCPR requires equal enjoyment of rights for both women and men, there is no official guidance with regards to men's rights. General Comment 28 focuses entirely on women. Paragraph 1 states:

> The Committee has decided to update its general comment on article 3 of the Covenant and to replace general comment No. 4 (thirteenth session, 1981), in the light of the experience it has gathered in its activities over the last 20 years. **The present revision seeks to take account of the important impact of this article on the enjoyment by women of the human rights protected under the Covenant.**

Similarly, the United Nations *Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights* has issued twenty-seven General Comments, including General Comment 16, which concerns Article 3 (equal rights between women and men) and General Comment 20, regarding Article 2 (non-discrimination). General Comment 16 focuses entirely on equal rights for women. General Comment 20 briefly recognisies that men may face discrimination; "Refusal to grant paternity leave may also amount to discrimination against men."[^60]

Additionally, States have a number of other instruments that provide comprehensive guidance on protecting and respecting the rights of women and girls. For example, the *Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women*, forty General Recommendations from the *Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women*, the *Beijing Declaration and Platform For Action*, the United Nations *Commission on the Status of Women*, and reports from the *Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women*.

Although, men and boys have the same human rights as women and girls, similar guidance for protecting and respecting men's rights is lacking. Commentators have argued that explicitly recognising men's rights is not necessary. For example,  Charlesworth[^2] argues that male over-representation in the development and administration of international human rights law means that human rights already accounts for men's rights by default. However, male representation has not lead to men's gender-specific human rights issues being addressed in a meaningful or substantive way. For example, Stemple[^3] points out there are no human rights instruments that explicitly address sexual violence against men, and Abramson[^4] says there is discrimination against boys in the children's rights movement.

Achieving equal enjoyment of rights between women and men requires thoroughly understanding women's and men's experiences of discrimination and inequality. Discrimination and inequality is not static, new forms can arise, so States need to continually monitor women's and men's human rights.[^5]

If States are to meet their obligations of equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex, it is necessary to explicitly identify States' obligations to men and boys.

## Government Obligations to men and boys

The *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* specifically recognises the rights of men and boys in Articles 2 and 3. Article 2 requires States to ensure all the rights to all individuals without discrimination based on sex, and Article 3 requires States to ensure equal enjoyment of rights for men and women.

 > The obligation to ensure to all individuals the rights recognized in the Covenant, established in articles 2 and 3 of the Covenant, requires that States parties **take all necessary steps to enable every person to enjoy those rights.**[^63] *Emphasis added*


### Which parts of government?

A state's obligations to men and boys involve all parts of the government and public authorities.

> All branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial), and other public or governmental authorities, at whatever level-national, regional or local-are in a position to engage the responsibility of the State Party.[^11]


## Take necessary steps

The ICCPR requires States to "take the necessary steps"[^16] to provide men their civil and political rights. This requirement is "unqualified and of immediate effect. A failure to comply with this obligation cannot be justified by reference to political, social, cultural or economic considerations within the State".[^17] Necessary steps include "legislative, judicial, administrative, educative and other appropriate measures."[^18]

Likewise, the ICESCR requires States to take steps "by all appropriate means" achieve men's full realisation of their economic, cultural and social rights.[^61] The ICESCR recognises that the  realisation of economic, cultural and social rights cannot happen all at once, and therefore allows for progressive realisation of these rights. However, "deliberate, concrete and targeted" steps must be taken to achieve men's equal enjoyment of the Covenant's rights.

### Specific obligations
Article 3 of both the ICCPR and ICESCR require States to ensure equal enjoyment of rights for men and for women.

> Article 3 implies that all human beings should enjoy the rights provided for in the Covenant, on an equal basis and in their totality.  The full effect of this provision is impaired whenever any person is denied the full and equal enjoyment of any right.  Consequently, States should ensure to men and women equally the enjoyment of all rights provided for in the Covenant.[^62]

> States parties are responsible for ensuring the equal enjoyment of rights without any discrimination.  Articles 2 and 3 mandate States parties to take all steps necessary, including the prohibition of discrimination on the ground of sex, to put an end to discriminatory actions, both in the public and the private sector, which impair the equal enjoyment of rights. -ICCPR GC 28 - p 4

### Acting in good faith

> **General Comment 31, Paragraph 3:** Article 2 defines the scope of the legal obligations undertaken by States Parties to the Covenant. A general obligation is imposed on States Parties to respect the Covenant rights and to ensure them to all individuals in their territory and subject to their jurisdiction (see paragraph 10 below). Pursuant to the principle articulated in article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, States Parties are required to give effect to the obligations under the Covenant in **good faith**.

### What steps are necessary?
#### Recognition of their obligations to men and boys
 If States are to meet their human rights obligations, they must recognise that this includes obligations to men and boys. 

Treating men's rights on equal terms with women's rights.


> These steps include the **removal of obstacles** to the equal enjoyment of such rights, the **education of the population and of State officials in human rights**, and the **adjustment of domestic legislation** so as to give effect to the undertakings set forth in the Covenant.  The State party must not only adopt measures of protection, but also **positive measures** in all areas so as to achieve the effective and equal empowerment of women.  States parties must **provide information** regarding the actual role of women in society so that the Committee may ascertain what measures, in addition to legislative provisions, have been or should be taken to give effect to these obligations, what progress has been made, what difficulties are encountered and what steps are being taken to overcome them. ICCPR GC 28 - p 3

> States parties are responsible for ensuring the equal enjoyment of rights without any discrimination.  Articles 2 and 3 mandate States parties to take all steps necessary, including the **prohibition of discrimination** on the ground of sex, to put an **end to discriminatory actions**, both in the public and the private sector, which impair the equal enjoyment of rights. ICCPR GC 28 - p 4

> States parties should **ensure that traditional, historical, religious or cultural attitudes are not used to justify violations** of women’s right to equality before the law and to equal enjoyment of all Covenant rights. States parties should **furnish appropriate information on those aspects of tradition, history, cultural practices and religious attitudes which jeopardize, or may jeopardize, compliance with article 3**, and indicate what measures they have taken or intend to take to overcome such factors.  ICCPR GC 28 - p 4

#### Removal of obstacles
> These steps include the **removal of obstacles** to the equal enjoyment of such rights - ICCPR GC 28 - p 3


##### Factors which impede
> In order to fulfil the obligation set forth in article 3, States parties should take account of the factors which impede the equal enjoyment by women and men of each right specified in the Covenant.  ICCPR GC 28 - p 6

#### Education
>  These steps include ... the **education of the population and of State officials in human rights** - ICCPR GC 28 - p 3


#### Adjusting legislation

> These steps include ... the **adjustment of domestic legislation** so as to give effect to the undertakings set forth in the Covenant.  ICCPR GC 28 - p 3

> 31. ... Laws which impose more severe penalties on women than on men for adultery or other offences also violate the requirement of equal treatment. ... States parties should review their legislation and practices and take the lead in implementing all measures necessary to eliminate discrimination against women in all fields, for example by prohibiting discrimination by private actors in areas such as employment, education, political activities and the provision of accommodation, goods and services.  States parties should report on all these measures and provide information on the remedies available to victims of such discrimination.

#### Positive measures
>  The State party must not only adopt measures of protection, but also **positive measures** in all areas so as to achieve the effective and equal empowerment of women. ICCPR GC 28 - p 3


#### Reporting

> States parties must **provide information** regarding the actual role of women in society so that the Committee may ascertain what measures, in addition to legislative provisions, have been or should be taken to give effect to these obligations, what progress has been made, what difficulties are encountered and what steps are being taken to overcome them. ICCPR GC 28 - p 3


See guidelines for reporting on CCPR regarding requirement to report on article 3

See CCPR General Comment No. 28 for reporting requirements

##### Reporting discrimination

The Human Rights Committee asks States to include discrimination against men in their reports. The Committee wants to know about laws, polices and practices to protect against discrimination, as well as any discrimination against men in fact. Discrimination against men by public authorities, the community, or by private persons or bodies should be included in reports.[^34]

#### Ensure traditional or cultural attitudes are not used as justifications to violate men's rights

#### Ensure marriage equality
> 23.	States are required to treat men and women equally in regard to marriage in accordance with article 23, which has been elaborated further by general comment No. 19 (1990).  Men and women have the right to enter into marriage only with their free and full consent, and States have an obligation to protect the enjoyment of this right on an equal basis.

> 25.	To fulfil their obligations under article 23, paragraph 4, States parties must **ensure that the matrimonial regime contains equal rights and obligations for both spouses with regard to the custody and care of children**, the children’s religious and moral education, the capacity to transmit to children the parent’s nationality, and the ownership or administration of property, whether common property or property in the sole ownership of either spouse.  

##### Marriage and family

.4 - States Parties to the present Covenant shall take appropriate steps to ensure equality of rights and responsibilities of spouses as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. In the case of dissolution, provision shall be made for the necessary protection of any children.

###### General Comment 19

> During marriage, the spouses should have equal rights and responsibilities in the family. This equality extends to all matters arising from their relationship, such as choice of residence, running of the household, education of the children and administration of assets. Such equality continues to be applicable to arrangements regarding legal separation or dissolution of the marriage.[^49]

> Thus, **any discriminatory treatment in regard to the grounds and procedures for separation or divorce, child custody, maintenance or alimony, visiting rights or the loss or recovery of parental authority must be prohibited**, bearing in mind the paramount **interest of the children** in this connection. States parties should, in particular, include information in their reports concerning the provision made for the necessary protection of any children at the dissolution of a marriage or on the separation of the spouses.[^50]

##### General Comment 17 

> \...If the marriage is dissolved, steps should be taken, keeping in view the paramount interest of the children, to give them necessary protection and, so far as is possible, to **guarantee personal relations with both parents**. \...[^51]

#### Equal protection of boys
> 28.	The obligation of States parties to protect children (art. 24) should be carried out equally for boys and girls.  States parties should report on measures taken to ensure that girls are treated equally to boys in education, in feeding and in health care, and provide the Committee with disaggregated data in this respect.  States parties should eradicate, both through legislation and any other appropriate measures, all cultural or religious practices which jeopardize the freedom and well-being of female children. 

##### Children's rights

States are required to adopt special measures to protect children. States must protect girls and boys equally[^52] and without discrimination.[^53]

Children are entitled to all of the civil and political rights in the Covenant.

The special measures to protect children in the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* are primarily about ensuring children have their civil and political rights. Additionally, this protection should extend to economic social and cultural measures.

> \...For example, *every possible economic and social measure should be taken* to reduce infant mortality and to eradicate malnutrition among children and **to prevent them from being subjected to acts of violence and cruel and inhuman treatment** or from being exploited by means of forced labour or prostitution, or by their use in the illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs, or by any other means. In the cultural field, every possible measure should be taken to foster the development of their personality and to **provide them with a level of education that will enable them to enjoy the rights recognized in the Covenant**, particularly the right to freedom of opinion and expression.[^54]

States must protect children from discrimination based on sex.[^55]

.1 - Every child shall have, without any discrimination as to \... sex, \... the right to such measures of **protection as are required by his status as a minor**, on the part of his family, society
and the State.

24.2 - Every child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have a name.

24.3 - Every child has the right to acquire a nationality.

> General Comment 28 -- p28. **The obligation of States parties to protect children (art. 24) should be carried out equally for boys and girls.** States parties should report on measures taken to ensure that girls are treated equally to boys *in education*, in feeding and in *health care*, and provide the Committee with disaggregated data in this respect. States parties should eradicate, both through legislation and any other appropriate measures, *all cultural or religious practices which jeopardize the freedom and well-being of female children*.[^56]

##### General comment 17

> Article 24 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes the right of every child, without any discrimination, to receive from his family, society and the State the protection required by his status as a minor. **Consequently, the implementation of this provision entails the adoption of special measures to protect children**, in addition to the measures that States are required to take under article 2 **to ensure that everyone enjoys the rights provided for in the Covenant**. The reports submitted by States parties often seem to underestimate this obligation and supply inadequate information on the way in which **children are afforded enjoyment of their right to a special protection**.[^57]

##### Circumcision

States must protect girls and boys equally. "States parties should eradicate, both through legislation and any other appropriate measures, *all cultural or religious practices which jeopardize the freedom and well-being of female children*."[^58]

This means that States should eradicate "all cultural or religious practices which jeopardize the freedom and well-being of *male* children."

Article 7
No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or
scientific experimentation

##### Genital mutilation recognised as a violation of article 7

> General Comment 28 -- p11 -
> **To assess compliance with article 7 of the Covenant, as well as with article 24, which mandates special protection for children**, the Committee needs to be provided information on national laws and practice with regard to domestic and other types of violence against women, including rape. It also needs to know whether the State party gives access to safe abortion to women who have become pregnant as a result of rape. The States parties should also provide the Committee with information on measures to prevent forced abortion or forced sterilization. **In States parties where the practice of genital mutilation exists information on its extent and on measures to eliminate it should be provided**. The information provided by States parties on all these issues should include measures of protection, including legal remedies, for women whose rights under **article 7** have been violated.[^59]

#### Protection from discrimination
> 31.	The right to equality before the law and freedom from discrimination, protected by article 26, requires States to act against discrimination by public and private agencies in all fields.



##### Equality

Equality is a fundamental principle of human rights. The *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* requires States to ensure men and women have equal enjoyment of their rights (Article 3), and that men are equal before the law and have equal protection of the law (Article 26).

Article 3 requires states to ensure men enjoy their rights in their totality and on and equal basis with women.[^6] States are required to "take all necessary steps"[^7] to ensure men enjoy all Covenant rights, and to "take account of the factors which impede"[^8] men's equal enjoyment of their rights.

Article 26 requires states to ensure men are equal before the law, and have equal protection of the law. States are required "to make such changes to domestic laws and practices as are necessary to ensure their conformity with the Covenant."[^9] requires equality before courts and tribunals. requires equal participation in public life.

### Non-discrimination

Non-discrimination is a fundamental principle of human rights which is incorporated into the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights*. For example, Article 2 requires States to ensure all the rights in the Covenant are recognised without distinction of any kind. Article 20 requires states to prohibit incitement to discrimination on racial or religious grounds. Article 26 prohibits discrimination and requires States to guarantee equal and effective protection against discrimination.

Although the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* does not define discrimination, the Human Rights Committee has clarified the meaning in General Comment 18:

> \[T\]he Committee believes that the term "discrimination" as used in the Covenant should be understood to imply any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference which is based on any ground such as race, colour, sex, \...and which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing, of all rights and freedoms.[^10]

The Covenant prohibits States from discriminating towards men, and requires States to protect men from discrimination.

Article 26 requires States' laws to guarantee that men have equal and effective protection against discrimination. It requires States to prohibit discrimination against men in law and in fact. This applies to all fields regulated and protected by public authorities. All legislation adopted by the State must not discriminate against men.[^12] If a State's laws do not align with the Covenant, the State must change its laws.[^13]

States are required to ensure equal protection for boys and girls[^14], and that children are free from discrimination.[^15]



### Ending discrimination against men

Ending discrimination against men in the public and private sector is a necessary step.[^19]

Ending discrimination requires analysis of laws and policies to identify any"distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference"[^20] that impairs men's enjoyment or exercise of their rights.

> "States parties should review their legislation and practices and take the lead in implementing all measures necessary to eliminate discrimination\... in all fields, for example by prohibiting discrimination by private actors in areas such as employment, education, political activities and the provision of accommodation, goods and services"[^21]

Gender analysis must be performed in a way that is *able to* and *effective at* detecting discrimination against men. If gender analysis reveals treatment that impairs the recognition men's rights, or men's enjoyment of their rights, "article 2 requires that the domestic law or practice be changed to meet the standards imposed by the Covenant's substantive guarantees."[^22] States may be able to justify differential treatment of men if it is reasonable, objective,[^23] necessary, proportionate, permissible under the Covenant, and intended to meet legitimate goals of the Covenant.[^24]

### Protecting men from discrimination

Article 26 requires State's laws "prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination". States are required to protect men from discrimination "in any field regulated and protected by public authorities",[^25] and by "public authorities, by the community, or by private persons or bodies".[^26]

A State's protection of men from discrimination must be "equal and effective".[^27]

Men must have the same legal protection from discrimination as women. In some situations protection is not equal, for example, equal pay legislation often does not protect men from pay discrimination. While historically pay discrimination exclusively affected women, the law must equally protect men from pay discrimination.

Protection mechanisms must be **effective** at protecting men from discrimination.
These are measures to protect women from discrimination that do not exist for men.

1.  Minister for women

2.  Ministry for women

3.  Women's equality strategy

4.  Women's health strategy

The application of protection mechanisms to prevent discrimination must be applied equally for men and women. Protection mechanisms intended to address all gender discrimination, such as gender analysis and gender budgeting, may not be applied equally. People charged with protecting men and women from discrimination must understand that it applies equally to men and women.

1.  Gender Budgeting -- only evaluated on impact on women, not men.

2.  Gender Analysis -- administered by Ministry for Women.

3.  BORA Section 7 -- not identifying discrimination against men in the law.

### Address discrimination against men

Not only must States refrain from discriminating against men, but States have a positive duty to guarantee men and boys have equal rights. For example requires States to ensure men have equal rights with regards to marriage, and at the dissolution of marriage. requires States to provide boys the same protection as girls, without discrimination.[^28]

> the positive obligations on States Parties to ensure Covenant rights will only be fully discharged if individuals are protected by the State, not just against violations of Covenant rights by its agents, but also against acts committed by private persons or entities that would impair the enjoyment of Covenant rights[^29]

States that permit discrimination against men or fail "to exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate or redress the harm" caused by discrimination against men, may be in breach of the Covenant.[^30]

States are also required to "take affirmative action in order to diminish or eliminate conditions which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination" against men. If there are conditions that impair men's enjoyment of their rights, States should act to correct those conditions. This may mean that, for a limited time, in specific matters, men may receive preferential treatment to correct for discrimination in fact.[^31]

#### remedy

> Article 2, paragraph 3, requires that in addition to effective protection of Covenant rights States Parties must ensure that individuals also have accessible and effective remedies to vindicate those rights\...
> Administrative mechanisms are particularly required to give effect to the general obligation to investigate allegations of violations promptly, thoroughly and effectively through independent and impartial bodies. National human rights institutions, endowed with appropriate powers, can contribute to this end. A failure by a State Party to investigate allegations of violations could in and of itself give rise to a separate breach of the Covenant. Cessation of an ongoing violation is an essential element of the right to an effective remedy.[^32]

##### Monitoring

the application of laws and policies is necessary to protect men from discrimination.

The Committee wants to know about discrimination *in fact*.
