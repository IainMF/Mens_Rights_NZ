When States ratify international human rights treaties they agree to be bound by them. A State's human rights obligations under these treaties are divided into three broad categories. *Respect*, *protect*, and *fulfil*. The obligation to **respect**, means that the government must not violate the rights of men and boys. The obligation to **protect**, means that the government must put laws and policies in place to prevent violations of human rights by non-government actors. For example, laws prohibiting domestic violence. The obligation to **fulfil**, means that the government must take positive steps to ensure that men and boys enjoy their rights in practice.

> The obligation to fulfil further contains duties to provide, promote and facilitate.[^1]

> The  obligation  to  fulfil  encompasses  the  obligation  of  States  parties  to  facilitate  access  to  and  provide  for  the  **full  realization  of  women’s  rights**.[^2] 

New Zealand has ratified both the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* (ICCPR) and the *International Covenant of Economic, Cultural and Social Rights* (ICESCR).

## The need for identify state obligations to men and boys
Governments are more likely to protect and respect rights when human rights guidance and jurisprudence explicitly identify how to protect and respect those rights. Although men and women have the same human rights, there are several instruments that provide comprehensive guidance on protecting and respecting the rights of women and girls but no similar guidance for men and boys. For example, the *Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women*, forty General Recommendations from the *Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women*, the *Beijing Declaration and Platform For Action*, the United Nations *Commission on the Status of Women*, and reports from the *Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women*.

The United Nations *Human Rights Committee* is responsible for receiving State reports on the ICCPR and issuing recommendations. The Committee has made thirty-seven General Comments on the interpretation of the ICCPR. General Comment 18 details State obligations of non-discrimination under Article 2  and General Comment 28 details State obligations to ensure equal rights between men and women (Article 3).

> Article 3 implies that all human beings should enjoy the rights provided for in the Covenant, on an equal basis and in their totality.  The full effect of this provision is impaired whenever any person is denied the full and equal enjoyment of any right.  Consequently, States should ensure to men and women equally the enjoyment of all rights provided for in the Covenant.[^3]

Although Article 3 of the ICCPR requires equal enjoyment of rights for both women and men, General Comment 28 focuses entirely on women; there is no official guidance from the *Human Rights Committee* regarding to men's rights. 

> The Committee has decided to update its general comment on article 3 of the Covenant and to replace general comment No. 4 (thirteenth session, 1981), in the light of the experience it has gathered in its activities over the last 20 years. **The present revision seeks to take account of the important impact of this article on the enjoyment by women of the human rights protected under the Covenant.** *Emphasis added*

Similarly, the United Nations *Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights* has issued twenty-seven General Comments relating the the ICESCR, including General Comment 16, on equal rights between women and men(Article 3) and General Comment 20, on non-discrimination(Article 2). General Comment 16 focuses entirely on equal rights for women. General Comment 20 briefly recognises that men may face discrimination; "Refusal to grant paternity leave may also amount to discrimination against men",[^4] but discussions of sex/gender discrimination focus on women.

Other treaties support men's right to equality and non-discrimination but, again, explicit guidance is lacking. Article 2 of the *Convention on the Rights of the Child* prohibits discrimination based on sex and Article 3 of the *Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities* affirms the principle of equality between men and women.

Commentators have argued that explicitly recognising men's rights is not necessary. For example,  Charlesworth[^5] argues that male over-representation in the development and administration of international human rights law means that human rights already accounts for men's rights by default. However, male representation has not lead to men's gender-specific human rights issues being addressed in a meaningful or substantive way. Stemple[^6] points out there are no human rights instruments that explicitly address sexual violence against men, and Abramson[^7] says there is discrimination against boys in the children's rights movement.

Without explicit recognition of State's human rights obligations to men and boys, States are unlikely to take action meet these obligations. A case of out-of-sight out-of-mind. Despite this, a State's obligations to men and boys can be derived from:
- explicit obligations to all people;
- explicit obligations of non-discrimination on basis of sex and equality between men and women;
- logically from explicitly stated obligations to women and the obligation for equality between men and women. Such as, the ICCPR's requirement for equal and effective protection from discrimination.[^8]

Additionally, identifying State's obligations to men and boys allows men's advocates to evaluate a State's compliance with human rights treaties and hold them accountable. 

> The policy must identify women within the jurisdiction of the State party (including non-citizen, migrant, refugee, asylum-seeking and stateless women) as the **rights-bearers**, with particular emphasis on the groups of women who are most marginalized and who may suffer from various forms of intersectional discrimination.[^9]

## Government obligations to men and boys
States that have ratified international human rights treaties have agreed to be legally bound by them. Multiple treaties recognise men's rights. The ICCPR recognises the rights of men and boys in Articles 2 and 3. Article 2 requires States to ensure all the rights to all individuals without discrimination based on sex, and Article 3 requires States to ensure equal enjoyment of rights for men and women.
 > The obligation to ensure to all individuals the rights recognized in the Covenant, established in articles 2 and 3 of the Covenant, requires that States parties **take all necessary steps to enable every person to enjoy those rights.**[^10] *Emphasis added*

Likewise, the ICECSR, recognises the rights of men and boys in Articles 2 and 3. These articles require States to ensure both men and women equally enjoy their covenant rights.

> Article 2, paragraph 2, of ICESCR provides for a guarantee of non-discrimination on the basis of sex among other grounds.  This provision, and the guarantee of equal enjoyment of rights by men and women in article 3, are integrally related and mutually reinforcing... [^11]

States are required "to take steps to ensure that in practice, men and women enjoy their economic, social and cultural rights on a basis of equality."[^12] Failure to ensure men equally enjoy their rights is a violation of the ICESCR.

> The principle of equality between men and women is fundamental to the enjoyment of each of the specific rights enumerated in the Covenant.  Failure to ensure formal and substantive equality in the enjoyment of any of these rights constitutes a violation of that right.[^13] 

### Non-derogable standard
Human rights treaties allow States to restrict or limit some human rights under specific, special circumstances. For example, under a state of emergency. These rights are [derogable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derogability). Provisions in human rights treaties of non-discrimination and equality between men and women are  not derogable. [^14] [^15] [^16]

### Which parts of government?
A state's obligations to men and boys involve all parts of the government and public authorities. [^160]
> All branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial), and other public or governmental authorities, at whatever level-national, regional or local-are in a position to engage the responsibility of the State Party.[^17]

Judges have an obligation to interpret laws in light of international human rights obligations and where national laws are inconsistent, to highlight these issues. [^18] [^19] 
> Domestic legal guarantees of equality and non-discrimination should be interpreted by these institutions in ways which facilitate and promote the full protection of economic, social and cultural rights. [^20] 

### Acting in good faith
> Article 2 defines the scope of the legal obligations undertaken by States Parties to the Covenant. A general obligation is imposed on States Parties to respect the Covenant rights and to ensure them to all individuals in their territory and subject to their jurisdiction (see paragraph 10 below). Pursuant to the principle articulated in article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, States Parties are required to give effect to the obligations under the Covenant in **good faith**.[^21]

## Take necessary steps
Human rights treaties require States to *take steps* to fulfil their obligations under the treaties. The ICCPR requires States to "take the necessary steps"[^22] to provide men and boys with their civil and political rights. This requirement is "unqualified and of immediate effect. A failure to comply with this obligation cannot be justified by reference to political, social, cultural or economic considerations within the State".[^23] [^24]  Necessary steps include "legislative, judicial, administrative, educative and other appropriate measures."[^25]

Likewise, the ICESCR requires States to take steps "by all appropriate means" achieve men's full realisation of their economic, cultural and social rights.[^26] 

### Progressive realisation
The ICESCR recognises that the  realisation of economic, cultural and social rights cannot happen all at once, and therefore allows for *progressive realisation* of these rights.[^27] Progressive realisation does not mean a State can put off its human rights obligations to men and boys. Indeed, ICECSR places two immediate obligations on States. One is  "the 'undertaking to guarantee' that relevant rights 'will be exercised without discrimination'"[^28]  against men and boys. The other is to take steps that are "deliberate, concrete and targeted as clearly as possible towards" meeting the Covenant's obligations to men and boys.[^29]

## What steps are necessary?
States are required to take the necessary steps to ensure men enjoy their human rights. The most important steps required are for a State to:
- **recognise its obligations to men and boys**; *and*
-  **treat these obligations as equally important** as its obligations to women and girls.

States must recognise disparities and disadvantages for men and boys *and also* recognise the human rights obligations to address those disparities or disadvantages. States must be proactive in identifying men's and boys' human rights issues and their obligations to respond. They must not assume that men's human rights are magically taken care of somehow. For example, a State may recognise that suicide is a human rights issues that affects people's right to life, and they may recognise that men have a higher rate of suicide than women, but fail to recognise that they have an obligation to address men's higher suicide rate to ensure men equally enjoy their right to life with women.

International human rights treaty bodies have identified several 'necessary steps', for example:

- the removal of obstacles that prevent men from enjoying their rights
- the education of the population and State officials
- the adjustment of domestic legislation to conform with human rights treaties[^30]
- the prohibition of discrimination against men and boys[^31]

### Removal of obstacles
States must take into account the 'factors that impede'[^32] men's enjoyment of their rights and remove any obstacles that prevent men's enjoyment of their rights.[^33] [^34] Logically, this means identifying these obstacles, which relates to the obligation to **monitor and report**, and create a **plan of action** (see below).

#### Stereotypes
States have an obligation to address stereotypes and prejudices against men and boys that are an obstacle to the enjoyment of their rights.[^35] [^36] States must takes steps to eliminate prejudices, custom, or practice "that perpetuate the notion of inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes".[^37] Logically this includes the idea that men's rights are less important than women's rights.


#### Recognition of existing disadvantage
 
 In order for states to meet their obligations to men and boys they must recognise and take account of existing disadvantages or inequality faced by men and boys.[^39] For example, health issues (including higher rates of amenable mortality, shorter life-expectancy and high suicide rate), bias in the justice system (including longer sentences for same crime), poorer educational outcomes, laws that explicitly discriminate against men, additional barriers for men who are victims of family and sexual violence etc.

> States parties should take into account that such laws, policies and practice can fail to address or even perpetuate inequality between men and women because they do not take account of existing economic, social and cultural inequalities...[^40]

Gender neutral polices and programs that fail to take into account existing disadvantages or inequalities faced by men may be discrimination.[^41] 

> In particular, it is incumbent upon States parties to take into account the effect of apparently gender-neutral laws, policies and programmes and to consider whether they could result in a negative impact on the ability of men and women to enjoy their human rights on a basis of equality. [^42] 

States are required to "take affirmative action in order to diminish or eliminate conditions which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination" against men. If there are conditions that impair men's enjoyment of their rights, States should act to correct those conditions. This may mean that, for a limited time, in specific matters, men may receive preferential treatment to correct for discrimination in fact.

> The Committee also wishes to point out that the principle of equality sometimes requires States parties to take affirmative action in order to diminish or eliminate conditions which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination prohibited by the Covenant. For example, in a State where the general conditions of a certain part of the population prevent or impair their enjoyment of human rights, the State should take specific action to correct those conditions. Such action may involve granting for a time to the part of the population concerned certain preferential treatment in specific matters as compared with the rest of the population. However, as long as such action is needed to correct discrimination in fact, it is a case of legitimate differentiation under the Covenant.[^44]

 A State's obligation to ensure formal and substantive equality for men may require the adoption of *temporary special measures* that favour men "in order to attenuate or suppress conditions that perpetuate discrimination".[^45] These measures are not considered discrimination against women as long as they are "necessary to redress de facto discrimination and are terminated when de facto equality is achieved"[^45]


> To design and implement policies and programmes to give long-term effect to the economic, social and cultural rights of both men and women on the basis of equality.  These may include the adoption of temporary special measures to accelerate women’s equal enjoyment of their rights, gender audits, and gender-specific allocation of resources;[^46]

Some permanent measures may be required to address men's inherent disadvantages.[^163] [^47] For example, State's have an obligation to ensure men can choose if and when they become a parent.[^162] However, men's and women's different biology means that men do not have the certainty that a child is theirs that women have. This paternity uncertainty allows a woman or the State can force a man into parenthood without his knowledge or consent. This may require some permanent measures to ensure men fully enjoy their reproductive rights.

> States parties are **encouraged to adopt temporary special measures to accelerate the achievement of equality between men and women in the enjoyment of the rights under the Covenant**.  Such measures are not to be considered discriminatory in themselves as they are grounded in the State’s obligation to **eliminate disadvantage caused by past and current discriminatory laws, traditions and practices**.  The nature, duration and application of such measures should be designed with reference to the specific issue and context, and should be adjusted as circumstances require.  The results of such measures should be monitored with a view to being discontinued when the objectives for which they are undertaken have been achieved.[^48]

##### Ensure traditional or cultural attitudes are not used as justifications to violate men's rights

### Non-discrimination
Non-discrimination is a fundamental principle of human rights. International human rights treaties prohibit States from discriminating against men and boys. For example, Article 2 if the ICCPR requires States to ensure all the rights in the Covenant are recognised without distinction of any kind. 

Discrimination against men and boys in international human rights law...

>  ... should be understood to imply any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference which is based on ... sex \...and which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing, of all rights and freedoms.[^49] [^50]

While human rights treaties prohibit discrimination based on sex, it is understood to include gender discrimination. So both discrimination based on beliefs, assumptions, about men and women, and that based on observable sex differences is prohibited.[^51]

Importantly, 
- Discrimination against men can occur due to the *effect or result* of policy or programs impairing men's rights. It does not have to been intentional.[^52]
- Discrimination includes acts and *failing to act* when it is required (omissions).[^53] [^161]
- States also have a due diligence obligation to protect men from discrimination from non-State actors.[^54] [^55] [^56] [^57] [^58] For example, states must enact laws that prohibit discrimination.
- Discrimination also includes incitement to discriminate and harassment.[^59] [^60] 
- Discrimination includes direct and indirect discrimaintion.[^61]

**See page on discrimination for more about discrimination.**

#### Prohibition of discrimination
A State's laws must "prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination".[^62] States are required to protect men from discrimination "in any field regulated and protected by public authorities",[^63] and by "public authorities, by the community, or by private persons or bodies".[^64] [^65]

> ...**the elimination of discrimination is fundamental to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights on a basis of equality**.[^66]

States must protect men from discrimination equally with women, and that protection must be effective. A State's mechanisms to prevent discrimination must be applied equally for men and women. Protection mechanisms intended to address all gender discrimination, such as gender-analysis and gender-budgeting are often considered to be primarily for women, but they must work equally as well for men. For example, New Zealand's gender-budgeting trial was inadequate because only assessed it effectiveness for women and girls. 

Similarly, in order to ensure equal and effective protection against discrimination to men, State officials must understand that the obligation to protect applies equally to men and women.

Not only must States refrain from discriminating against men, but States have a positive duty to guarantee men and boys have equal rights with women and girls. For example requires States to ensure men have equal rights with regards to marriage, and at the dissolution of marriage. requires States to provide boys the same protection as girls, without discrimination.[^67]

States that permit discrimination against men or fail "to exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate or redress the harm" caused by discrimination against men, may be in breach of the their human rights obligations.[^68]

#### Gender analysis
In order for States to protect men from discrimination, they must  collect sex disaggregated data and perform gender-analysis.[^69] Gender analysis must be performed in a way that is *able to* and *effective at* detecting discrimination against men. If gender analysis reveals treatment that impairs the recognition or enjoyment of men's rights, ICCPR "article 2 requires that the domestic law or practice be changed to meet the standards imposed by the Covenant's substantive guarantees."[^70] States may be able to justify differential treatment of men if it is reasonable, objective,[^71] necessary, proportionate, permissible under the Covenant, and intended to meet legitimate goals of the Covenant.[^72]

> To design and implement policies and programmes to give long-term effect to the economic, social and cultural rights of both men and women on the basis of equality.  These may include the adoption of temporary special measures to accelerate women’s equal enjoyment of their rights, **gender audits**, and gender-specific allocation of resources; [^73]

See **Monitoring and Reporting** for more

Additionally, States need to prevent new forms of discrimination[^74]  from appearing and  "should also adopt appropriate preventive measures to avoid the emergence of new marginalized groups."[^75] Thus, even in States where no discrimination against men exists, States have an obligation to prevent it from arising. 

#### Systemic discrimination
States have an obligation to "adopt an active approach to eliminating systemic discrimination and segregation"[^76] against men. "\[S]ystemic discrimination can be understood as legal rules, policies, practices or predominant cultural attitudes in either the public or private sector which create relative disadvantages for [men], and privileges for [women]."[^77] For example, attitudes and beliefs that elevate women's rights and devalue men's rights are considered normal and acceptable. 

The New Zealand Human Rights Commission describes structural discrimination:

> Structural discrimination can occur unintentionally, and includes informal practices that have become embedded in everyday organisational life and effectively become part of the system, i.e. “how we do things around here.” Put simply, it can be discrimination by habit, rather than intent.[^78]

Systemic discrimination results in unquestioned policy and practices which disadvantage men that are defended and justified as 'the way things are'. For example, men's persistent over-representation in prison by fifteen to twenty times is accepted as normal, and evidence of bias and discrimination against men in the justice system is dismissed, minimised or ignored. **See page on discrimination in the justice system for more.**

To address systemic discrimination against men and boys, States should:[^79]
- Use incentives to encourage people to "change their attitudes and behaviour" to men and boys so that they do not face systemic discrimination. 
- Raise awareness of systemic discrimination against men and boys.
-  Adopt "strict measures against incitement to discrimination".
- Ensure that laws and polices to prevent discrimination against men and boys are implemented in practice.


### Education
States must educate the population and state officials about men's human rights[^80] [^81]. States have a continuous obligation to condemn discrimination against men and boys, and "to proclaim to their population and the international community their total opposition to all forms of discrimination" against men and boys, [^74] and to  "promote the elimination of all forms of discrimination"[^82] against men and boys.

State officials are responsible for enacting the State's human rights obligations and, therefore, they must understand the State's obligations to men and boys. This is especially important for State officials who are in a position to severely violate human rights, such as police officers, and judges.[^83]  

> States  parties  should  ensure  that  all  Government  bodies  and  organs  are  fully  aware  of  the  principles  of  equality  and  non-discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex  and  gender  and  that  adequate  training  and  awareness-raising  programmes  are  set  up  and  carried  out in this respect.[^84]

Note: As there is no CEDAW equivalent, it is important that government officials receive training about men's rights.

#### Public education and  Awareness raising
States have an obligation to educate the public about their human rights. This should include ensuring men and boys are "aware  of  their  right  to  equality  without discrimination"[^85]

School curricular should include education on equality and non-discrimination.[^86] [^87] Such education should be non-discriminatory and treat men's rights as equally important as women's rights. Significant issues for both men's and women's rights should be included.


>  Teaching on the principles of equality and non discrimination should be integrated in formal and non-formal inclusive and multicultural education, with a view to dismantling notions of superiority or inferiority based on prohibited grounds and to promote dialogue and tolerance between different groups in society[^88]

Education and public awareness campaigns should support and encourage the work of men's advocates.[^89] The State should ensure men's "non-governmental organizations are well-informed, adequately consulted and generally able to play an active role in the initial and subsequent development of the policy." [^90]


### Adjusting legislation and policy
States have an obligation to ensure their legislation is aligned with the international human rights treaties they have ratified.[^91] [^92] The ICCPR grants men and boys the right to equality under the law and equal protection of the law, as well as "equal and effective"[^93] protection from discrimination in the law. 

States must periodically review their legislation, policy and programmes to ensure they do not violate men's right to equality and non-discrimination.[^94]  [^95] Additionally, States should take into account the effect of supposedly gender-neutral laws and policy to ensure they do not have the effect of disadvantaging or discriminating against men and boys.[^96]

> The obligation to respect requires States parties to refrain from discriminatory actions that directly or indirectly result in the denial of the equal right of men and women to their enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. Respecting the right obliges States parties **not to adopt, and to repeal laws and rescind, policies, administrative measures and programmes that do not conform with the right protected by article 3**.  In particular, it is incumbent upon States parties to **take into account the effect of apparently gender-neutral laws, policies and programmes** and to consider whether they could result in a negative impact on the ability of men and women to enjoy their human rights on a basis of equality.[^97] *Emphasis added*

> Other **laws should be regularly reviewed** and, where necessary, amended in order to ensure that they do not discriminate **or lead to discrimination**, whether formally or substantively, in relation to the exercise and enjoyment of Covenant rights.[^98]

### Adequate resources

States must provide adequate resources to ensure men and boys enjoy all of their human rights.[^99] Generally this means "equality in the allocation of resources"[^100] although in some situations ensuring that men equally enjoy their rights with women will require "gender-specific allocation of resources".[^101]

Insufficient resources is cannot be used as an excuse for discrimination, "unless every effort has been made to use all resources that are at the State party’s disposition in an effort to address and eliminate the discrimination".[^102]

### Monitoring and Reporting
International human rights treaties require States to monitor and report on their implementation of those treaties.[^103] [^104] Therefore, States must monitor men's enjoyment of their rights.

A State's human rights monitoring must be be effective.[^105]

#### Indicators and benchmarks
> States parties are **obliged to monitor effectively the implementation of measures to comply with article 2, paragraph 2**, of the Covenant. Monitoring should assess both the steps taken and the results achieved in the elimination of discrimination. National strategies, policies and plans should use **appropriate indicators** and benchmarks, disaggregated on the basis of the prohibited grounds of discrimination[^106]

> Developing and establishing valid indicators of the status of and progress in the realization of human rights of women, and establishing and maintaining databases disaggregated by sex and related to the specific provisions of the Convention[^107] 

#### Gender sensitive
To reveal inequalities and discrimination, monitoring must be able to detect how human rights issues affect women and men differently. That is, monitoring must be *gender-sensitive*. 

> A gender-sensitive analysis is therefore instrumental to tailoring specific and action-oriented recommendations on the responses that are needed to address human rights violations, protect victims' rights and contribute to the prevention and non-recurrence of such violations.[^108]

The *Manual on Human Rights Monitoring* recommends taking a *gender perspective* to ensure that all violations against women and men are recognised and accounted for:

> Integrating a gender perspective in human rights monitoring is a process to ensure that all violations against men and women of all ages and sections of society are recognized and accounted for. It is also a strategy for making women's as well as men's experiences and concerns an integral dimension of the design and implementation of the monitoring cycle. It helps to better understand the causes and types of human rights violations and, hence, the measures required for prevention and protection.[^109]

The *Manual* emphasises that human rights monitoring requires a proactive attitude and that differences in men's human rights should be made visible. 

> Integrating gender implies a **proactive** attitude of looking at and analysing how situations affect women, girls, men and boys differently. It is also about making such differences **visible** throughout the monitoring cycle. *Emphasis in original*

State's monitoring should ensure that polices designed to ensure equality between men and women do not have  "unintended adverse effects"[^110]

> An HRBAD should include equal participation of women and men and adopt a gender perspective throughout its process. This means disaggregating statistics by sex, as well as going beyond biological and physiological characteristics. In addition, statistical and data collection work should take into account the relationship between women and men based on socially or culturally constructed and defined identities, status, roles and responsibilities that may have been assigned to one or the other sex. Similar approaches should also be applied to other population groups, as relevant.[^111] 

#### Reports
Particularly, States should monitor and report on their compliance with Article 3 of both ICCPR and ICESCR which requires equal enjoyment of rights between men and women.[^112] States must not interpret Article 3 to only apply to women, as New Zealand has in its reports. See ** page for complaint to MoJ Regarding NZ reporting**

States reports must include "sufficient data and statistics"[^113] to allow treaty bodies to asses progress in men's equal enjoyment of their rights. That is, State's reports must include sex-disaggregated data when ever it is available or explanations for why it is not.

> Disaggregated statistics, provided within specific time frames, are necessary to measure the progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights by men and women[^114]

States are required to report on discrimination against men, both formal and substantive. The *Human Rights Committee* asks States to include discrimination against men in their reports. The Committee wants to know about laws, polices and practices to protect against discrimination, as well as any discrimination against men *in fact*. Discrimination against men by public authorities, the community, or by private persons or bodies should be included in reports.[^115]

> States parties are obliged to monitor **effectively** the implementation of measures to comply with article 2, paragraph 2, of the Covenant. Monitoring should assess both the steps taken and the results achieved in the elimination of discrimination. National strategies, policies and plans should use appropriate indicators and benchmarks, disaggregated on the basis of the prohibited grounds of discrimination[^116]

> ... Failure to **adopt, implement and monitor effects of laws, policies and programmes** to eliminate de jure  and de facto discrimination with respect to each of the rights enumerated in articles 6 to 15 of the Covenant constitutes a violation of those rights.[^117]

see also General Comment 31 paragraphs 15-20??

> States  parties  have  an  international  responsibility  to  create  and  continuously  improve statistical  databases  and the  **analysis of all forms of discrimination** against women in general and against women belonging to specific  vulnerable groups in particular.[^118]

> States parties must **provide information** regarding the actual role of women in society so that the Committee may ascertain what measures, in addition to legislative provisions, have been or should be taken to give effect to these obligations, **what progress has been made, what difficulties are encountered and what steps are being taken to overcome them**.[^119]

See CCPR General Comment No. 28 for reporting requirements

#### Right to information
Men's, and men's advocates', ability to hold their government accountable is directly related to their knowledge of men's rights issues and the government response. Men have a right to be informed of the States positive and negative actions (or inaction) regarding their rights.[^120] [^121] States have an obligation to ensure men and men's advocates have access to relevant information and "are able to effectively promote and claim" their rights[^122] Therefore a State's monitoring and reporting of men's rights should be available and accessible to men and men's advocates.[^123]

> To give effect to the right of access to information, States parties should **proactively put in the public domain Government information of public interest**.[^124]

CEDAW reporting provides detailed information about a State's response to their human rights obligations to women. 

### National Plan of Action
States should have a *National Plan of Action* for human rights which includes

> ... Among other things, States parties must, integrate into national plans of action for human rights **appropriate strategies to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights**[^125]
>  These strategies should be based on the **systematic identification of policies, programmes and activities** relevant to the situation and context within the State, as derived from the **normative content of article 3** of the Covenant and spelled out in relation to the levels and nature of States parties’ obligations referred to in paragraphs 16 to 21 above.  The strategies should give particular attention to the **elimination of discrimination** in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.[^126]

> States parties should ensure that strategies, policies, and plans of action are in place and implemented in order to address both formal and substantive discrimination by public and  private actors in the area of Covenant rights. Such policies, plans and strategies should address **all groups distinguished by the prohibited grounds** and States parties are encouraged, among other possible steps, to adopt temporary special measures in order to accelerate the achievement of equality.[^127]

> National strategies, policies and plans should use **appropriate indicators** and benchmarks, disaggregated on the basis of the prohibited grounds of discrimination[^128]


> This  means  that  the  State  party  must  **immediately  assess**  the  de  jure  and  de  facto  situation  of  women  and  take  concrete  steps  to  formulate  and  implement  a  policy  that is targeted as clearly as possible towards the goal of fully eliminating all forms of  discrimination  against  women  and  achieving  women’s  substantive  equality  with  men. ... Such  a  policy  must  comprise  constitutional  and  legislative  guarantees,  including  an  alignment  with  legal  provisions  at  the  domestic  level  and  an  amendment  of  conflicting  legal  provisions.  It  must  also  include  other  appropriate  measures,  such  as  **comprehensive  action  plans  and  mechanisms  for  monitoring  and  implementing  them**,  which  provide  a framework  for  the  practical  realization  of the  principle  of  formal and  substantive equality of women and men.[^129] 

> **The  policy  must  be  comprehensive**  in  that  it  should  apply  to  all  fields  of  life,  including  those  which  are  not  explicitly  mentioned  in  the  text  of  the  Convention. It  must  apply  to  both  public  and  private  economic  spheres,  as  well  as  to  the  domestic  sphere,  and  ensure  that  all branches of  Government (executive, legislative and judicial branches) and all  levels  of  Government  assume  their  respective  responsibilities  for  implementation.  It  should  incorporate  the  entire  range  of  measures  that  are  appropriate  and  necessary  in  the  particular  circumstances of the State party.[^130] 

> The policy must identify women within the jurisdiction of the State party (including non-citizen, migrant, refugee, asylum-seeking and stateless women) as the **rights-bearers**, with particular emphasis on the groups of women who are most marginalized and who may suffer from various forms of intersectional discrimination.[^131]   


### Representation in decision making
States must ensure that men are represented in decision making. This means ensuring that men's needs and human rights are considered so that men benefit from the decisions that are made.[^132] Simple numerical representation of men in decision making is not sufficient to ensure men's needs are taken into account. 

> The right of individuals and groups of individuals to participate in decision-making processes that may affect their development must be an integral component of any policy, programme or activity developed to discharge governmental obligations under article 3 of the Covenant.[^133]

### Remedy
States have an obligation to provide remedy to men and boys whose rights have been violated.

> - To make available and accessible appropriate remedies, such as compensation, reparation, restitution, rehabilitation, guarantees of non-repetition, declarations, public apologies, educational programmes and prevention programmes. 
> - To establish appropriate venues for redress such as courts and tribunals or administrative mechanisms that are accessible to all on the basis of equality, including the poorest and most disadvantaged and marginalized  men and women;[^134]

> National policies and strategies should provide for the establishment of effective mechanisms and institutions where they do not exist, including administrative authorities, ombudsmen and other national human rights institutions, courts and tribunals.  These institutions should **investigate and address alleged violations relating to article 3** and provide remedies for such violations.  States parties, for their part, should ensure that such remedies are effectively implemented.[^135]

> National legislation, strategies, policies and plans should provide for mechanisms and institutions that effectively address the individual and structural nature of the harm caused by discrimination in the field of economic, social and cultural rights. ... These institutions should also be empowered to provide effective remedies, such as compensation, reparation, restitution, rehabilitation, guarantees of non-repetition and public apologies, and State parties should ensure that these measures are effectively implemented Domestic legal guarantees of equality and non-discrimination should be interpreted by these institutions in ways which facilitate and promote the full protection of economic, social and cultural rights.[^136]

> Among the measures which might be considered appropriate, in addition to legislation, is the provision of judicial remedies with respect to rights which may, in accordance with the national legal system, be considered justiciable. The Committee notes, for example, that the enjoyment of the rights recognized, without discrimination, will often be appropriately promoted, in part, through the provision of judicial or other effective remedies. Indeed, those States parties which are also parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are already obligated (by virtue of articles 2 (paras. 1 and 3), 3 and 26) of that Covenant to ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms (including the right to equality and non-discrimination) recognized in that Covenant are violated, “shall have an effective remedy” (art. 2 (3) (a)). In addition, there are a number of other provisions in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, including articles 3, 7 (a) (i), 8, 10 (3), 13 (2) (a), (3) and (4) and 15 (3) which would seem to be capable of immediate application by judicial and other organs in many national legal systems. Any suggestion that the provisions indicated are inherently non-self-executing would seem to be difficult to sustain.[^137]

> Article 2, paragraph 3, requires that in addition to effective protection of Covenant rights States Parties must ensure that individuals also have accessible and effective remedies to vindicate those rights\...
> Administrative mechanisms are particularly required to give effect to the general obligation to investigate allegations of violations promptly, thoroughly and effectively through independent and impartial bodies. National human rights institutions, endowed with appropriate powers, can contribute to this end. A failure by a State Party to investigate allegations of violations could in and of itself give rise to a separate breach of the Covenant. Cessation of an ongoing violation is an essential element of the right to an effective remedy.[^138]

> Subparagraph (b) contains the obligation of States parties to ensure that legislation prohibiting discrimination and promoting equality of women and men provides appropriate remedies for women who are subjected to discrimination contrary to the Convention. This obligation requires that States parties provide reparation to women whose rights under the Convention have been violated. Without reparation the obligation to provide an appropriate remedy is not discharged. Such remedies should include different forms of reparation, such as  monetary  compensation,  restitution,  rehabilitation  and  reinstatement;  measures  of satisfaction, such as public apologies, public memorials and guarantees of non-repetition; changes in relevant laws and practices; and bringing to justice the perpetrators of violations of human rights of women.[^139]


> States parties must ensure that women can invoke the principle of equality in support  of  complaints  of  acts  of  discrimination  contrary  to  the  Convention,  committed  by  public  officials  or  by  private  actors.  States  parties  must  further  ensure  that  women  have  recourse  to  affordable,  accessible  and  timely  remedies,  with  legal  aid  and  assistance  as  necessary,  to  be  settled  in  a  fair  hearing  by  a  competent  and  independent  court  or  tribunal,  where  appropriate.  Where  discrimination  against  women  also  constitutes  an  abuse  of  other  human  rights,  such  as  the  right  to  life  and  physical  integrity  in,  for  example,  cases  of  domestic  and  other  forms  of  violence,  States  parties  are  obliged  to initiate  criminal proceedings,  bring  the  perpetrator(s) to trial and impose appropriate penal sanctions. States parties should  financially support independent associations and centres providing legal resources for  women  in  their  work  to  educate  women  about  their  rights  to  equality  and  assist  them  in  pursuing remedies for discrimination.[^140] 

> ensure that women are able to make complaints about violations of their rights under the Convention and have access to effective remedies[^141] 

### Accountability

> Effective  implementation  of  the  Convention  requires  that  a  State  party  be accountable to its citizens and other members of its community at both the national and international levels. In order for this accountability function to work effectively, appropriate mechanisms and institutions must be put in place.[^142]  

### No Retrogression
> The adoption and undertaking of any retrogressive measures that affect the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of the all the rights set forth in the Covenant constitutes a violation of article 3.[^143]

> Moreover, any deliberately retrogressive measures in that regard would require the most careful consideration and would need to be fully justified by reference to the totality of the rights provided for in the Covenant and in the context of the full use of the maximum available resources.[^144]
> 
### Specific obligations

#### Ensure marriage equality
International human rights treaties explicitly require States to treat men and women equally in family matters, such as marriage and care of children.[^145] 

> ... it is a positive duty of States parties to make certain that spouses have equal rights as required by the Covenant.[^146]

> To fulfil their obligations under article 23, paragraph 4, States parties must **ensure that the matrimonial regime contains equal rights and obligations for both spouses with regard to the custody and care of children**, the children’s religious and moral education, the capacity to transmit to children the parent’s nationality, and the ownership or administration of property, whether common property or property in the sole ownership of either spouse.[^147] 


> Thus, **any discriminatory treatment in regard to the grounds and procedures for separation or divorce, child custody, maintenance or alimony, visiting rights or the loss or recovery of parental authority must be prohibited**, bearing in mind the paramount **interest of the children** in this connection. States parties should, in particular, include information in their reports concerning the provision made for the necessary protection of any children at the dissolution of a marriage or on the separation of the spouses.[^148]

> \...If the marriage is dissolved, steps should be taken, keeping in view the paramount interest of the children, to give them necessary protection and, so far as is possible, to **guarantee personal relations with both parents**. \...[^149]

> During marriage, the spouses should have equal rights and responsibilities in the family. This equality extends to all matters arising from their relationship, such as choice of residence, running of the household, education of the children and administration of assets. Such equality continues to be applicable to arrangements regarding legal separation or dissolution of the marriage.[^150]


#### Equal protection of boys
States have a special duty to protect children. This duty must be carried out equally for boys and girls.

States are required to ensure equal protection for boys and girls[^151], and that children are free from discrimination.[^152]

> **The obligation of States parties to protect children (art. 24) should be carried out equally for boys and girls.**  States parties should report on measures taken to ensure that girls are treated equally to boys in education, in feeding and in health care, and provide the Committee with disaggregated data in this respect.  States parties should eradicate, both through legislation and any other appropriate measures, all cultural or religious practices which jeopardize the freedom and well-being of female children.[^153]

> In relation to children, article 24 provides that all children, **without any discrimination** as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, national or social origin, property or birth, have the right to such measures of **protection as are required by their status as minors**, on the part of their family, society and the State.[^154]

#### Children's rights

Children are entitled to all of the civil and political rights in the Covenant.

The special measures to protect children in the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* are primarily about ensuring children have their civil and political rights. Additionally, this protection should extend to economic social and cultural measures.

> \...For example, *every possible economic and social measure should be taken* to reduce infant mortality and to eradicate malnutrition among children and **to prevent them from being subjected to acts of violence and cruel and inhuman treatment** or from being exploited by means of forced labour or prostitution, or by their use in the illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs, or by any other means. In the cultural field, every possible measure should be taken to foster the development of their personality and to **provide them with a level of education that will enable them to enjoy the rights recognized in the Covenant**, particularly the right to freedom of opinion and expression.[^155]

States must protect children from discrimination based on sex.[^156]

.1 - Every child shall have, without any discrimination as to \... sex, \... the right to such measures of **protection as are required by his status as a minor**, on the part of his family, society and the State.

24.2 - Every child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have a name.

24.3 - Every child has the right to acquire a nationality.

##### General comment 17

> Article 24 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes the right of every child, without any discrimination, to receive from his family, society and the State the protection required by his status as a minor. **Consequently, the implementation of this provision entails the adoption of special measures to protect children**, in addition to the measures that States are required to take under article 2 **to ensure that everyone enjoys the rights provided for in the Covenant**. The reports submitted by States parties often seem to underestimate this obligation and supply inadequate information on the way in which **children are afforded enjoyment of their right to a special protection**.[^157]

#### Address violence
States have an obligation to act with due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish violence against men and boys.

> Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Covenant requires that States parties recognize that the widest possible protection and assistance should be accorded to the family, and that marriage must be entered into with the free consent of the intending spouses.  Implementing article 3, in relation to article 10, requires States parties, inter alia, **to provide victims of domestic violence, who are primarily female, with access to safe housing, remedies and redress for physical, mental and emotional damage**; to ensure that men and women have an equal right to choose if, whom and when to marry - in particular, the legal age of marriage for men and women should be the same, and **boys and girls should be protected equally from practices that promote child marriage**, marriage by proxy, or coercion; and to ensure that women have equal rights to marital property and inheritance upon their husband’s death.  **Gender-based violence is a form of discrimination that inhibits the ability to enjoy rights and freedoms, including economic, social and cultural rights, on a basis of equality**.  States parties **must take appropriate measures to eliminate violence against men and women** and act with **due diligence** to prevent, investigate, mediate, punish and redress acts of violence against them by private actors.[^158]

>  Discrimination  against  women  on  the basis  of  sex  and gender  comprises,  as  stated in  general recommendation No. 19 on violence against women, gender-based violence,  namely,  violence  that  is  directed  against  a  woman  because  she  is  a  woman  or  violence  that  affects  women  disproportionately.  It  is  a  form  of  discrimination  that  seriously  inhibits  women’s  ability  to  enjoy  and  exercise  their  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  on  the  basis  of  equality  with  men.  It  includes  acts  that  inflict  physical,  mental  or  sexual  harm  or  suffering,  threats  of  such  acts,  coercion  and  other  deprivations  of  liberty,  the  violence  that  occurs  within  the  family  or  domestic  unit  or  within  any  other  interpersonal  relationship,  or  violence  perpetrated  or  condoned  by  the  State  or  its  agents  regardless  of  where  it  occurs.  Gender-based  violence  may  breach  specific  provisions  of  the  Convention,  regardless  of  whether  those  provisions  expressly  mention  violence.  States  parties  have  a  due  diligence  obligation to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish such acts of gender-based violence.[^159]
