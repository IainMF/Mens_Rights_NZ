## Right to education

New Zealand has accepted recommendations to reduce inequities in the education system[^1] however boys and men are behind at all levels of education. Historically, boys had an advantage in education; however girls started performing better than boys as early as 1985.[^2]

## Pre school

The Growing Up in New Zealand (GUiNZ) assessed literacy skills of 4.5 year-olds using tools that measure letter naming speed and the ability to write their name in a recognisable way. More boys (22%) than girls (16%) are in the at-risk category for naming letters. Fewer boys(41%) than girls (68%) could write their name.[^3]

> **Literacy learning in early learning services**

> “In some services, however, boys were not well catered for and were often bored with the literacy activities provided. Most services with some differentiation provided books and resources, or planned different activities and environments, so both boys and girls had access to literacy learning that would engage them. This is not meant to imply there should be gender-specific activities available, but that teachers need to ensure that boys are engaged by literacy activities”[^4]
### Primary school

In years 1-8 fewer boys than girls are meeting national standards. In 2016 the percentage of boys meeting or exceeding national standards is slightly lower than for girls in maths (75.0% vs 75.9%), but there is a bigger difference for reading (73.6% vs 82.1%) and a bigger difference still for writing (63.4% vs 79.4%). The same trend is seen in Ngā Whanaketanga Rumaki Māori (Māori education).[^5]

The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study shows that average reading comprehension achievement at Year 5 is lower for boys (512) than for girls (533). **The difference is larger in New Zealand than many other countries.**

The National Monitoring Study of Student Achievement shows the difference in average achievement between boys and girls in reading at both Year 4 and Year 8 is about one year of schooling, while in writing it is about one and a half years.

> “Some commentators suggest this finding may be indicative of gendered expectations of boys to be more active learners and girls to be more passive learners. Others argue that texts and tasks at an early age favour the interests of girls over that of boys. **Whatever the reason, the outcome is that more boys than girls are labelled as poor readers and writers and have trouble using these skills to access other parts of the curriculum.”**[^6]

### Secondary school

Secondary school students work towards the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA). NCEA has three levels of certificate, depending on the difficulty of the standards. Overall achievement rates for students are increasing but boys lag behind girls at all NCEA levels. Fewer boys attain NCEA in the expected year of schooling (e.g. level 1 in year 11) and fewer boys attain each NCEA level before they leave school. The largest gap is for NCEA level 3. In 2016 60.3% girls achieved level 3 while only 47.7% of boys did. A 12.6 percentage point difference.

In the Programme for International Student Assessment(PISA), boys are more likely to perform below the baseline reading standard and less likely to be a top performer, compared to girls.

Secondary school boys are over-represented in the lowest achievers and under-represented in the highest achievers, compared to girls. This has been consistent for at least a decade

> “For female school leavers in 2019, NCEA Level 2 attainment (81%) was higher than for their male counterparts (76%). **This may indicate the importance of literacy for overall performance in NCEA**”[^7]
#### Dropping out, suspensions and expulsions

Secondary Schools have four levels of consequences for bad behaviour. Stand-downs (least severe), suspensions, exclusion and expulsion (most severe). In 2016, boys received 3 times as many stand downs and suspensions, 3.3 times as many exclusions and 3.6 times as many expulsions, compared to girls. Fewer boys than girls stay in school until 17 (81.0% vs 86.3%). [^8]

### Tertiary education

In 2015 8.5% of men and 11.0% of women were enrolled in tertiary education. Fewer men are completing their tertiary education, compared to women. At tertiary level only 4 out 10 people who gain tertiary certificates, diplomas, or bachelor degrees and above are men. Overall participation in tertiary education has grown but so has the gap between men and women. A large disparity exists between the number of men (2.8%) and women (4.2%) studying a bachelor’s degree. The result of the increased participation and completion of tertiary education by women has led to women with bachelor’s degrees outnumbering men since 2006.[^9]

Men are under-represented at University.

Women with degrees outnumber men with degrees. The gap between women and men is increasing.

Among 15-29 year olds, there are more men than women with no qualification, and more women than men with a degree.
