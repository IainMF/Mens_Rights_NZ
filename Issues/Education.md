## Right to education

New Zealand has accepted recommendations to reduce inequities in the education system[^1] however boys and men are behind at all levels of education. Historically, boys had an advantage in education; however girls started performing better than boys as early as 1985.[^2]

## Pre school

The Growing Up in New Zealand (GUiNZ) assessed literacy skills of 4.5 year-olds using tools that measure letter naming speed and the ability to write their name in a recognisable way. More boys (22%) than girls (16%) are in the at-risk category for naming letters. Fewer boys(41%) than girls (68%) could write their name.[^3]

> **Literacy learning in early learning services**

> “In some services, however, boys were not well catered for and were often bored with the literacy activities provided. Most services with some differentiation provided books and resources, or planned different activities and environments, so both boys and girls had access to literacy learning that would engage them. This is not meant to imply there should be gender-specific activities available, but that teachers need to ensure that boys are engaged by literacy activities”[^4]
### Primary school

In years 1-8 fewer boys than girls are meeting national standards. In 2016 the percentage of boys meeting or exceeding national standards is slightly lower than for girls in maths (75.0% vs 75.9%), but there is a bigger difference for reading (73.6% vs 82.1%) and a bigger difference still for writing (63.4% vs 79.4%). The same trend is seen in Ngā Whanaketanga Rumaki Māori (Māori education).[^5]

The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study shows that average reading comprehension achievement at Year 5 is lower for boys (512) than for girls (533). **The difference is larger in New Zealand than many other countries.**

The National Monitoring Study of Student Achievement shows the difference in average achievement between boys and girls in reading at both Year 4 and Year 8 is about one year of schooling, while in writing it is about one and a half years.

> “Some commentators suggest this finding may be indicative of gendered expectations of boys to be more active learners and girls to be more passive learners. Others argue that texts and tasks at an early age favour the interests of girls over that of boys. **Whatever the reason, the outcome is that more boys than girls are labelled as poor readers and writers and have trouble using these skills to access other parts of the curriculum.”**[^6]

### Secondary school

Secondary school students work towards the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA). NCEA has three levels of certificate, depending on the difficulty of the standards. Overall achievement rates for students are increasing but boys lag behind girls at all NCEA levels. Fewer boys attain NCEA in the expected year of schooling (e.g. level 1 in year 11) and fewer boys attain each NCEA level before they leave school. The largest gap is for NCEA level 3. In 2016 60.3% girls achieved level 3 while only 47.7% of boys did. A 12.6 percentage point difference.



Secondary school boys are over-represented in the lowest achievers and under-represented in the highest achievers, compared to girls. This has been consistent for at least a decade

> “For female school leavers in 2019, NCEA Level 2 attainment (81%) was higher than for their male counterparts (76%). **This may indicate the importance of literacy for overall performance in NCEA**”[^7]

| 2024 Leavers' Attainment | Boys % | Girls % |
| ------------------------ | :------: | :-------: |
| NCEA Level 1             | 83.1   | 85.4    |
| NCEA Level 2             | 74.5   | 77.8    |
| NCEA Level 3             | 51.6   | 59.5    |
| University Entrance      | 34.7   | 46      |

#### PISA
In the Programme for International Student Assessment(PISA), boys are more likely to perform below the baseline reading standard and less likely to be a top performer, compared to girls.
![[PISA 22 Reading.svg]]
In Mathematics, on average boys outperform girls, but the lowest scoring 10% of boys score lower than the lowest 10% of girls.
![[PISA 22 Maths.svg]]

In Science, on average, boys and girls perform the same, however lowest scoring 10% of boys score lower than the lowest 10% of girls. The reverse is true for the highest 10% of boys and girls.

![[PISA 22 Science.svg]]
There are more boys who are low performers than girls in each subject.
![[PISA 22 Low performers.svg]]
There are fewer boys than girls who are the top performers in reading. For science and maths the are more boys than girls who are top performers.

#### Dropping out, suspensions and expulsions

Secondary Schools have four levels of consequences for bad behaviour. Stand-downs (least severe), suspensions, exclusion and expulsion (most severe). In 2016, boys received 3 times as many stand downs and suspensions, 3.3 times as many exclusions and 3.6 times as many expulsions, compared to girls. Fewer boys than girls stay in school until 17 (81.0% vs 86.3%). [^8]

### Tertiary education

In 2015 8.5% of men and 11.0% of women were enrolled in tertiary education. Fewer men are completing their tertiary education, compared to women. At tertiary level only 4 out 10 people who gain tertiary certificates, diplomas, or bachelor degrees and above are men. Overall participation in tertiary education has grown but so has the gap between men and women. A large disparity exists between the number of men (2.8%) and women (4.2%) studying a bachelor’s degree. The result of the increased participation and completion of tertiary education by women has led to women with bachelor’s degrees outnumbering men since 2006.[^9]

Men are under-represented at University.

Table 10: All Universities have more females than males attending.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**University**|**Females for every 100 males**|
|Massey|213|
|Waikato|178|
|AUT|170|
|Otago|156|
|Victoria|150|
|Canterbury|138|
|Auckland|133|
|Lincoln|117|

Women with degrees outnumber men with degrees. The gap between women and men is increasing.

Among 15-29 year olds, there are more men than women with no qualification, and more women than men with a degree.

Report: [What you need to know about UNESCO’s global report on boys’ disengagement from education | UNESCO](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/what-you-need-know-about-unescos-global-report-boys-disengagement-education)

https://archive.ph/gHSu2

# Key facts and figures

> global estimates indicate that 259 million children and youth were out of school in 2020, 132 million of them boys  
> [...]
> 
> Boys are more likely than girls to repeat primary grades in 130 of 142 countries with data, indicating poorer progression through school.  
> [...]
> 
> several low and middle-income countries have seen a reversal in gender gaps, with boys now lagging behind girls in enrolment and completion.

# The trend

Where girls were disadvantaged, things are getting more equal. Where boys were disadvantaged, things are getting worse:

> Since 2000, the proportion of countries with data showing gender disparities at girls’ expense in lower secondary enrolment, for example, has reduced from 34 percent to 24 percent of countries. The share of countries where fewer boys are enrolled than girls, on the other hand, has increased marginally at primary level and remains unchanged at lower secondary level, at just 22 percent of countries

# Government response

> Despite clear gendered patterns in education in some countries, programmes and initiatives addressing boys’ disengagement from and disadvantage in education remain few. System-level policies to address boys’ constraints are even more rare.
> 
> [...]
> 
> A few programmes and initiatives aimed principally at girls as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic have benefited boys.

# Bonus: Tertiary education

In high-income countries, women significantly outperform men in higher education. This trend is now visible globally:

> At the global level, almost no country with data has achieved gender parity at the tertiary level. The gender parity index (adjusted) data in 2019 for tertiary enrolment showed 88 young men for every 100 young women. In all regions except sub-Saharan Africa, young men are disadvantaged in tertiary enrolment. This disadvantage is particularly acute in the North America and Western Europe and the Latin America and the Caribbean regions, where 81 young men for every 100 young women are enrolled at tertiary education.

# Bonus: Reading vs math

Girls are better at reading; boys are better at math. Make your own conclusion.

> Gaps in **reading** skills are found to start early. In 23 of 25 countries with data for proficiency in reading at Grade 2/3, the proportion of girls achieving minimum proficiency in reading is higher than the share of boys.  
> [...]
> 
> In **mathematics** the gender gap that once worked against girls at the start of the millennium has narrowed or equalized with boys in half of all countries with data.

# Bonus: Corporal punishment

> Disciplinary practices meted out by teachers are often highly gendered and include corporal punishment and harsh physical labour, especially for boys.
> 
> All countries surveyed, apart from Nigeria, reported higher percentages of boys experiencing physical violence from a male teacher (Together for Girls, 2021). Yet [...] a study in Delhi, India found that female teachers were more likely than male teachers to physically punish male students, as a means to assure male students’ respect and reinforce their authority (Ginestra, 2020).

# Bonus: Child labor

From 56% to 61% of children engaged in child labor are boys:

> In 2020, the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated that 160 million children – or 1 in 10 children worldwide – were engaged in child labour, of which 97 million were estimated to be boys.
> 
> [...]
> 
> While a higher proportion of boys (11 percent) than girls (8 percent) are engaged in child labour (Figure 16), once the child labour definition expands to include 21 hours or more on household chores, the gender gap between boys and girls is reduced by half (ILO, 2021).

# Bonus: "Rationale"

UNESCO offers this rationale for why boys' education is important:

> Globally, improving educational opportunities for girls continues to be of paramount importance  
> [...]
> 
> Better-educated men are more likely to help in the household and take on care responsibilities  
> [...]
> 
> boys who have a secondary education are more likely to condemn gender-based violence
