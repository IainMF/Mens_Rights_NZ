Suicide disproportionately affects men. The Health New Zealand Te Whatu Ora Mortality Collection[^1] reports between 1948 and 2020, 20571 males and 7302 females died from intentional self harm. For every female suicide there were approximately 2.8 male suicides. As percentages, 73.8\% of suicides were male and 26.2\% were female.

## Historical Data

The Ministry of Health reports suicide statistics back to 1921.[^2] The male suicide rate shows more variability than the female rate.

## Government obligations

Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that:

> Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.

The government has an obligation to prevent arbitrary deprivation of life, such as suicide. The United Nations Human Rights Committee states:

> While acknowledging the central importance to human dignity of personal autonomy, States should take adequate measures, without violating their other Covenant obligations, to prevent suicides, especially among individuals in particularly vulnerable situations, including individuals deprived of their liberty[^3]

The committee emphasises the important of preventing suicide of prisoners.

> The duty to protect the life of all detained individuals includes providing them with the necessary medical care and appropriate regular monitoring of their health, shielding them from inter-prisoner violence, **preventing suicides** and providing reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities. A heightened duty to protect the right to life also applies to individuals quartered in liberty-restricting State-run facilities, such as mental health facilities, military camps, refugee camps and camps for internally displaced persons, juvenile institutions and orphanages.[^4] Emphasis added

## Government actions

The Government has released their Suicide Prevention Action Plan 2025–2029.[^5] Although they recognise that men are disproportionately affected by suicide, there is no specific or targeted plan to reduce male suicide. A shortcoming of the plan is the focus on mental health, but a significant proportion of men who die by suicide did not show any mental health issues.

## Issues in addressing male suicide

Reasearch shows[^6] mental health professionals "showed a greater willingness to treat and refer female patients compared with male patients". Other research shows most men who die by suicide had contact with support services prior to their death.[^7]
