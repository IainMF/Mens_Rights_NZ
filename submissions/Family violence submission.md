Submission to the Joint Venture on Family and Sexual Violence

> We must do things differently -- we must transform the system"

Quote from Hon Marama Davidson - Minister for the Prevention of Family and Sexual Violence

Kia Ora,

I welcome this government's courage to face the wicked problem of family and sexual violence.

The family and sexual violence system should work equally well for everybody. 166,000 men have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime and 230,000 men have experienced sexual violence in their lifetime[^1] These men deserve the best support and care we can give them.

Previous governments failed to give men that care. Male victims were excluded from the development of previous government\'s family and sexual violence system.

For example, our response to family violence is built on the 2003 NZ Violence Against Women (VAW) Study which excludes men by design:

> The prevalence statistics arising from the NZ VAW Study provided foundational information that has supported the work of the violence sector for the ensuing 17 years. The prevalence statistics continue to be widely used by government agencies, non-governmental organisations and the media, and have catalysed responses such as the establishment of the Family Violence: It's Not OK Campaign.\[Fanslow 2021\] [^2]

This has been a serious epistemological and moral problem.

Evidence-based policy is only effective with robust epistemology. Excluding men from the evidence base means our understanding of family and sexual violence is incomplete. Perhaps evidence from men's experiences is the a critical piece for solving the puzzle.

More importantly, it is wrong make decisions that affect male victims without good data about male victims. Human rights advocates summarise it as "Nothing about us, without us".

As the Family Violence Death Review Committee says, it is necessary "for services to take time to comprehend victims' experiences"[^3]

The Glenn Inquiry identified three important aspects for an effective family and sexual violence system.

> For a system to work and be effective, the people using it and working in it must be able to:

> • have trust that they will be respected and people will do the right things

> • have faith that their needs will be recognised and met, and

> • believe the people working in it are both compassionate and responsive.[^4]

> --- The People's Blueprint \| Transforming the way we deal with child abuse and domestic violence in New Zealand

So in the context of male victims:

-   The system must show respect for male victims
-   The system must show male victims that their needs are recognised and will be met
-   The system must be compassionate and responsive to male victims.

Previous systems have not done those things

## System causing harm and secondary abuse 

> **The current family violence system can result in a range of unintentionally harmful responses to victims**

> FVDRC 5th report - think differently about family violence

The failure of previous governments to fully involve and consider the needs of male victims has harmed male victims. Abusers have been enabled to continue abuse of male victims and the system itself contributes to secondary abuse.

Secondary abuse occurs when victims are treated badly by 'support' services.

> Participants also reported secondary abusive experiences, with police and other support services responding with ridicule, doubt, indifference, and victim arrest.

> Male Victims of Female-Perpetrated Intimate Partner Violence, Help-Seeking, and Reporting Behaviors: A Qualitative Study

The result of secondary abuse is higher risk of mental health issues.

> if victims are subjected to secondary victimisation, for example victim blaming, ridicule and dismissal, and not given the support they require, male victims are at increased risk of anxiety, depression and PTSD

> Male Victims of Intimate Partner Violence: A Challenge to the Gendered Paradigm - Deborah Powney and Nicola Graham-Kevan[^5]

### Child abuse

Additionally, exposure to family violence is a form of child abuse. Failing to identify and support male victims neglects the abuse of children who are in those homes.

> **For children, the exposure to family violence, even when the child is not a direct target, is itself an extremely serious form of abuse**.

> **It is well known that exposure to IPV is a form of child abuse** and that there is a high rate of co-occurrence between IPV and the physical abuse of children.

> FVDRC 4^th^ report

## Explicit inclusion

An effective system must have the voices and needs of male victims specifically and explicitly included in the strategy. Male victims must have confidence that the system will work for them.

# The exclusion and minimisation of male victims

The exclusion and minimisation of male victims in New Zealand has occurred across a wide range of domains and must be addressed.

If male victims are to have confidence in the family and sexual system broad changes must be made.

## Men's experiences of exclusion

Unfortunately there is little research on the male victims experiences of the family and sexual violence system in New Zealand. However, what evidence we have shows that men are treated poorly.

> The three male family violence victims **were unanimous in feeling misunderstood and discriminated against by police**, reporting that police officers refused to listen to their side of the story.[^6]

> --- Victims' Voices: The Justice Needs and Experiences of New Zealand Serious Crime Victims.

> \...a woman expressed concern about the lack of support for her male partner who had been assaulted by her son. To quote her:

> "**my partner feels absolutely unsupported**, completely unsupported. He's changed ... He's become angry, irritable, depressed. ... He's giving up."[^7]

> --- 12 Week Review of Cases Referred to The Family Violence Integrated Safety Response (ISR) Pilot

> A male victim felt that it was difficult to access the counselling support they wanted and highlighted\... a service gap.

> *There's definitely a link missing between ACC and the Ministry of Justice in terms of therapeutic services provided. In terms of making it accessible and also perhaps I felt like it was, the whole way through in* *terms of the rehabilitative services offered were often catered towards women.[^8] *

> --- Improving the justice response to victims of sexual violence : victims\' experiences

### Expert opinion

Many experts recognise the issues for male victims:-

### Mind the gap

Canterbury Men's Centre released the Mind the Gap[^10] report in 2016 with the views of family violence professionals. The report describes the structural inequities for male victims. Here are a selection of quotes from those professionals describing what it is like for male victims.

> I've had a couple of guys here who've been abused, they ring up the police and they describe it as if they were stupid to think that would work. They're the victim, the police come around, they get removed and yet is was them that made the phone call. It was them that made the complaint. Sometimes they hear that yeah, we get you were the one who phoned us up, and it takes two to tango and you're the guy. What was interesting for me was there was no anger in that guy. There was just an acceptance. I'm a guy. This is my life. (Community Worker)

> Men have reported that they've gone to the police with a perfectly legitimate issue around being assaulted or being the receiver of the violence and yet they are the ones who seem to be put on trial... And that story gets around and so men don't come forward. (Domestic Violence Worker)

> I think it's men not knowing that it's family violence when it is. And there's also the idea that men can fix their own stuff, and only going for help as a point of last resource. There's something to be said for shame. How can they go in when their partners are attacking them? Being seen as they should be able to handle it. "How come you let it get like this"? (Domestic Violence Worker)

> The males knows very definitely that they're being beaten up and they don't know what to do. Some will say that I'm going to end the relationship. But I hear three months later that no, they're still in there. They say no I can cope. But I really do get worried about their sense of who they are because it seems that just like a woman there's erosion of their self-worth. They come in grieving for that. (General Practitioner)

> We have very few men come to us and say I'm a victim of family violence. So it's hard to put a figure on that. And often if they are presenting to us as a victim of family violence the perpetrator is another man. The ex-husband or the new boyfriend. So one of the main dynamics of male victims of family violence is that very few of them report to us where they are the victims of women's family violence perpetrated by women. (We know it is happening) but they're not coming forward. (Police Officer)

> 

> What we do know is we're males. So we've got to live in a male patriarchal dominated society. We accept that women are victims. Males are not allowed to be victims in a patriarchal society. So therefore you're a victim here and you're living in a patriarchal society however you're also living in a society where you're automatically seen as a perpetrator as well regardless because you're a male. (Community Worker)

> One of the reasons men don't engage is that they see the support that is out there for women and they don't see the media support that says they can be victims of violence. (Domestic Violence Worker)

> We have a Wahine programme with regards to violence as well. This is not something that's funded by anybody but CYF and those women have a tendency to come out and say, yeah, I smashed him with a glass ashtray. And I threw something and it hit. Look, we do have violent women out there. Realllly violent women. (Domestic Violence Worker)

> I hear the point of view that's put across is that the women feel more fear. And I can get my head around that. But the assumption is that men don't feel that fear. And I've worked with two clients, possibly more, that were terrified to go home at night. Would drive halfway up the drive and see their partner's car there. And they'd go away because they just couldn't stand the effect. They'd wait until she would go to work or go out and then they would go home. There's fear there. (Domestic Violence Worker)

### Overseas research

More detailed analysis comes form overseas research.

> Men's violence against intimate female partners is considered more serious than women's violence against intimate male partners. **As a result, many men fear that seeking help would label them as aggressor, especially if they defend themselves. This double standard view in society has resulted in many male victims not seeking the assistance of law enforcement as well. **

> Male Victims of Intimate Partner Violence in the United States: An Examination of the Review of Literature through the Critical Theoretical Perspective[^11]

> Analyses suggested that the help-seeking process of male PV victims is complex and heterogeneous **and can often lead to further negative consequences due to various structural, cultural, social, and organizational factors.** The findings also highlight the potential societal issues that male victims perceived as contributing to male victimization and lack of available resources for them. The results are discussed in terms of its implications for agencies, service providers, and general societal attitudes that are relevant to raising awareness about this phenomenon[^12]

> Machado, A., Hines, D., & Douglas, E. M. (2020). Male victims of female-perpetrated partner violence: A qualitative analysis of men's experiences, the impact of violence, and perceptions of their worth. Psychology of Men & Masculinities, 21(4), 612--621. https://doi.org/10.1037/men0000285

> **Empirical evidence from this mixed-method study suggests that male victims face many interpersonal and societal obstacles**. Feeling uncomfortable when requesting assistance, men in IPA situations are affected by a masking factor that causes them to hide their situation and contributes to a misconception factor that causes people to treat men as the sole perpetrator. Although men are eligible, services may not be perceived as being available or helpful. **The study yields important implications for social work practice, and the findings result in several recommendations for increased awareness about IPA, advocacy for gender-inclusive services, revision of laws and policies, increased research, and emphasis on funded and anonymous services**.[^13]

> Most participants who avoided seeking help did so due to their own lack of recognition of abuse and ability to assess their risk of harm, attempts to keep the family intact, masculine stereotypes, and excuses for their partner's abuse. Some men who expressed an interest in seeking help were discouraged from it due to **fear for their personal safety, a potential revictimization in the legal system, and the lack of support services available to men**. This research suggests that the individuals who are abused in relationships, service providers, and the public at large could benefit from professional training about gender inclusive approaches to intimate partner abuse.[^14]

One particular issue is men often don't recognise the abuse

> Across several studies, men viewed women's acts of aggression directed towards them as not violent, and women who admit to committing acts of aggression did not report using violence.

> Men's Experience of Psychological Abuse: Conceptualization and Measurement Issues[^15]

## Exclusion of male victims in **r**esearch 

Male victims voices and experiences must be captured by good research if the system is to work for them. Unfortunately, men have been excluded from much research. For example, men have been excluded from specialised population surveys.

> **Specialised population-based surveys of violence against women have been identified as the gold-standard** for obtaining the necessary data to guide national level responses to this critical problem ... **By design, these surveys also do not gather information on men's experience of violence.**

> Methods for the 2019 New Zealand family violence study- a study on the association between violence exposure, health and well-being https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1177083X.2020.1862252

> The report does not "deal with men's and boy's experiences as victim/survivors of sexual violence, and women as perpetrators. ...**there are gaps in knowledge about these issues**...

> Lightning Does Strike Twice: preventing sexual revictimisation -- Ministry of Women's Affairs September 2012

> One reason that male victims of severe IPV by women have been ignored in the typology **is that they have rarely, if ever, been systematically studied**

> Characteristics of Callers to the Domestic Abuse Helpline for Men[^16]

>  **The scholarly neglect of this topic has limited our overall understanding of violence in intimate relationships,**

> Male Victims of Intimate Partner Violence in the United States: An Examination of the Review of Literature through the Critical Theoretical Perspective[^17]

Instead of including male victims the research into family and sexual violence has focused on female victimisation. The result is methodology that works for capturing the scope of female victimisation but not for the scope of male victimisation.

> **Societal perceptions of IPV as a predominantly female issue have led to the development of research perspectives, frameworks, measures, and methodologies unable to capture the full scope of male victimization**. Research has also been hampered by a reluctance from men to identify as victims, and many do not relate to commonly used terminology of IPV, such as domestic violence.

> Violence, Help-Seeking, and Reporting Behaviors: A Qualitative Study

Overall, we do not have a good understanding of the experiences of male victims.

> A review of the literature on men's experience of IPV, particularly psychological abuse, **suggests that there is not yet a thorough and well grounded conceptual understanding of this phenomenon**.

> Men's Experience of Psychological Abuse: Conceptualization and Measurement Issues[^18]

There is blind spot in our understanding because we have a narrow range of evidence.

> \"Social pressure can cause evidence to pile up on one side of a debate or issue, while evidence on the other side is systematically screened out. A person who looks at the evidence as it is presented, then, will form a warped view of the matter, even if she rationally evaluates the evidence at hand. I will suggest that whenever there exists social pressure to conceal evidence on one side of a topic, we should suspect that a (possibly dangerous) blind spot is lurking somewhere, due to this mechanism. The catch, and it is a big catch, is that the blind spot will not be recognizable by people who simply look at the evidence as it is presented. They will be unaware that their view of the world is distorted."

> Why It\'s OK to Speak Your Mind - Hrishikesh Joshi[^19]

### Notable examples of male victims being excluded in research and academia

Two notable examples of excluding men's experiences are from influential academics Evan Stark, and Mary Koss.

Even Stark literally wrote the book on Coercive Control. He asks readers to ignore the experiences of male victims and just believe him.

> "At this point, **I ask readers to take two things on faith**: That the pattern of intimidation, isolation, and control \... is unique to men's abuse of women and that it is critical to explaining why women become entrapped in abusive relationships in ways that men do not \..."[^20]

Mary Koss is a pioneering, highly influential sexual violence researcher. Her research has been cited over 45,000 times.

Koss's survey design was used in Gavey's 1991 Sexual victimization prevalence among New Zealand university students[^21] which only studied female victimisation and male perpetration.

Koss has stated that male victims of female perpetrators are not 'rape' victims but only experience 'unwanted contact'. This significantly minimises male victims experiences.

> Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.[^22]

In a radio interview she describes a women 'raping' a man as only 'unwanted contact'.[^23]

> **Theresa Phung:** \"So I am actually speaking to someone right now. his story is that he was drugged, he was unconscious and when he awoke a woman was on top of him with his penis inserted inside her vagina, and for him that was traumatizing.\"

> ...

> **Dr. Koss:** \"What would I call it? I would call it \'unwanted contact\'.\"

## Models excluding men's experiences or minimising them.

The models we use for family violence victimisation exclude or minimise men's experiences.

> Social conditioning shapes professionals' attitudes, beliefs and practices ...

> Beliefs about how the world works, formed through expectations from a particular culture, determine the goals, structures and rules of a system ...

> Whose world view am I prioritising? ...

> What is the evidence base that this is a safe, effective and equitable service structure?

> FVDRC 6^th^ report

### Duluth Model

The Duluth model is a widely used model for understanding partner violence. It was developed by listening to women from a battered women's shelter. The experiences of male victims were not considered.

This means programs and polices based on this model are, at best, insufficient to meet the needs of male victims.

> Many family violence programmes were originally based on the Family Abuse Intervention Project Programme, originally designed in the early 1980s in Duluth, Minnesota.

> The Duluth approach, as it is known, is a psycho-educational model based on feminist analysis. Treatment of perpetrators under this approach focuses on teaching them about the power and control elements within male-female relationships that can contribute to family violence.

> Treatment of perpetrators is only one part of the Duluth approach, which also focuses on changing societal attitudes towards women. When first introduced in the 1980s, programmes in New Zealand were explicitly modelled on the Duluth approach.

> Family Violence Perpetrator Treatment - EVIDENCE BRIEF https://www.justice.govt.nz/assets/Documents/Publications/Family-Violence-Perpetrator-Treatment.pdf

The Duluth mod![](Pictures/100000000000066E000004D2BB65B2DE.png){width="10.783cm" height="7.782cm"}el is used by the New Zealand Police.

The proponents of the model describe it as based on "feminist political ideology"[^24] which lead to a focus on power and control. Later one of the founders admits this was confirmation bias and did not truly represent what the women were telling them.

> \"By determining that the need or desire for power was the motivating force behind battering, we created a conceptual framework that, in fact, did not fit the lived experience of many of the men and women we were working with. The DAIP staff \[\...\] remained undaunted by the difference in our theory and the actual experiences of those we were working with \[\...\] It was the cases themselves that created the chink in each of our theoretical suits of armor. Speaking for myself, I found that many of the men I interviewed did not seem to articulate a desire for power over their partner. Although I relentlessly took every opportunity to point out to men in the groups that they were so motivated and merely in denial, the fact that few men ever articulated such a desire went unnoticed by me and many of my coworkers. **Eventually, we realized that we were finding what we had already predetermined to find.**"

> ---Ellen Pence - Coordinating Community Responses to Domestic Violence: Lessons from Duluth and Beyond.[^25]

## Exclusion of male victims in expertise/consultations

Previous governments have excluded or minimised male victims from their consultations. For example, the Ministry for Women is the government's expert on family and sexual violence. Obviously women's voices and needs should be considered government, however there is no equivalent to provide expertise on male victims.

For government policy to work for male victims and not create secondary abuse, the voices and needs of male victims must be considered in government policy with the same level of expertise, experience and authority as the Ministry for Women.

### Ministry for women

The Ministry for Women provides policy advice to the government with the goal of, amongst others, ensuring all women and girls are free from all forms of violence and harassment.

The Ministry provides gendered advice to other government agencies (including the Ministry of Justice and the Police) to support its goal of ending violence against women and girls. It is included in the development of the family and sexual violence strategy and believes it can take a leadership role.

> We are the government's expert on violence against women, providing advice to government on how best to reduce violence. An effective government response to violence reduction, however, is not the sole responsibility of one agency. We work together with various agencies to make sure policies take into account the issue of violence against women and its impacts.

> --- https://women.govt.nz/safety[^26]

Although the Ministry recognises the needs of male victims, its mandate is limited to women and girls. It does not have the mandate to speak for men and boys, or develop expertise and experience in the issues for male victims.

The governments advice regarding family and sexual violence is biased by the Ministry for Women's limited mandate.

> A strong gender analysis is a critical component of the Government's response to family violence and sexual violence. **The Minister for Women will help to ensure this gender analysis** through the Social Wellbeing Committee's oversight of this response, as one of its priorities. The Ministry for Women also has an important advisory role to the joint venture of the Social Wellbeing Board to support the Board's delivery of this priority work programme. [^27]

One of the MfW's intended outcomes for it's work is to:

> **Ensure women and girls perspectives are included in family and sexual violence prevention policy**; address intersectionality issues for women and girls that makes them more vulnerable to family and sexual violence.[^28]

The Ministry for Women's advice must be complemented by advice from experts on male victims.

## It's not okay

The It's Not Okay campaign is a public awareness campaign about family violence which excluded male victims through tit's development and implementation.

> The Campaign was designed to reframe family violence as a serious social issue, build a shared understanding of what constitutes family violence, and promote a belief that it is possible to do something about it

> --- An innovative approach to changing social attitudes around family violence in New Zealand: key ideas, insights and lessons learnt[^29]

During the planning stages, they did not consider men as victims. They consulted organisations with expertise regarding women as victims (the National Collective of Independent Women's Refuges) and men as **perpetrators** (the National Network of Stopping Violence Services).[^30]

Prior to the research being undertaken, it was thought that the Campaign might start by addressing male violence towards intimate partners.** **

The research was "Thirty-seven in-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with **male perpetrators"[^31]** who were already involved in stopping violence programs. This biased research supported the development of the campaign.

Two sets of television advertisements have been developed. The first set featured local celebrities and ordinary New Zealanders, men and women, voicing short messages about what's not okay.

The second phase of the Campaign focused on perpetrators' stories, **took a gendered approach to family violence**. The advertisements featured four men, not actors, telling their personal stories.

The campaign was concerned that showing female perpetrators might

"*undermine policies designed to prevent and reduce male partner violence against women".[^32] *The campaign did not consider how this would affect male victims and possibly lead to secondary abuse. For example,

> \[It\] may lead the majority to assume that only severe violence to women is 'domestic violence', and anything less is 'normal' in relationships, especially aggression by women towards men.

> The Gendered Perspective of Domestic (Intimate Partner) Violence: A Review of the Evidence[^33]

Later the campaign did research into the effectiveness of their strategy, including a survey about New Zealander's attitude to family violence. The research neglected to ask respondents about their attitude to female violence or male victimisation. Instead restricting the questions to:

-   Attitudes, values and beliefs related to gender-roles and **men's violence towards women**
-   Attitudes to defences/excuses for **male violence to women**

The results show that nearly all New Zealanders reject male to female violence. 93% of respondents agree that "a man should never raise a hand against a woman". However, we don't know how many New Zealanders reject partner violence committed by women. Although the survey hints that most people don't see female violence as serious. 92% agree that a women hitting a man first is no excuse for a man to hit a women. Presumably these people did not consider the need for a man to defend himself and relied on negative stereotypes about men and women.

-   This is speculation because the research was not done when the opportunity was there.

### Consequences

The consequences of excluding male victims from development and implementation of the campaign could be serious. At worst, it normalises and enables the abuse of male victims, by making it seem insignificant.

Other consequences might be that male victims receive less sympathy, support and services.

> The second practical implication of this study relates to the types of IPV services available. **The findings suggest that male victims may perceive that they will not receive as much sympathy as female victims. Research has determined that men who seek services usually do not receive the help they need**

> \...

> Public health officials have successfully called attention to the prevalence of men's violence against women, **but have been unsuccessful in addressing situations of female perpetration or male victimization**.

> News Stories of Intimate Partner Violence: An Experimental Examination of Participant Sex, Perpetrator Sex, and Violence Severity on Seriousness, Sympathy, and Punishment Preferences[^34]

## White ribbon

MPs, police, and other public servants regularly wear a white ribbon. As a symbol they are condemn violence against women. Male victims are aware that White Ribbon excludes them.

The White Ribbon Campaign Trust Deed describes the purpose of the trust is solely about changing men's attitudes to violence against women.

> • Change men\'s attitudes and behaviours, predominantly through men talking to men about violence against women;

> • Encourage wearing a white ribbon as a personal pledge to never commit, condone or remain silent about violence towards women;

> • Encourage and support men to take leadership in national and community driven efforts to end violence against women;

> • Undertake local campaigns and activities to create social change to end all forms of violence towards women;

> --- White Ribbon Campaign Trust Deed[^35]

This demonstrates to male victims that the government considers them unimportant. If male victims are to have confidence in the governments family and sexual violence system, public servants must not support White Ribbon in their official capacity.

## Ministry of Health

The Ministry of Health recommends that all females over 16 are asked about family violence as a matter of routine. For males, they should only be asked if the is indication that family violence might have occurred.[^36] Although the Ministry recognises that "Domestic violence flourishes because of silence, because the problem stays hidden, and in some subtle but powerful way \... acceptable.[^37]

This means that:

-   Male victims, who are less likely to admit being a victim, will be missed

-   Statistics generated from the health system don't accurately represent the incidents of family violence

-   The opportunity to educate men on what constitutes family violence is missed

-   Men don't visit the doctor as much as women, so opportunity for providing support to male victims is already lower

-   Doctors get a false impression of the rates of family violence between men and women. This could lead to overlooking the signs of family violence in men.

Research has shown that some men would be receptive to support from primary health care.

> The primary healthcare setting was regarded as a suitable and safe place to talk about violence by some, suggesting an overlap with the theme of confidentiality.

> --- Help-seeking by male victims of domestic violence and abuse (DVA): a systematic review and qualitative evidence synthesis[^38]

## Government websites

Government websites that provide information for victims of family violence do not make it clear where male victims can get help. Contact details for support services often use gender neutral terms when men are included but mention women often. Men are mentioned as perpetrators so they can contact a stopping violence service.

****One of the barriers for men receiving support is they don't know there is support. Government websites must give male victims clear guidance about how to get help.****

### Shielded** **site

Many government website included the Women's Refuge Shielded Site service which excludes males victims. The shielded site says:

> We warmly welcome all women and their children to access our support, advocacy and crisis accommodation.

The shielded site can easily be adapted to include information for male victims. The Government must make that happen so that it is providing the same service to both men and women.

## **L**aws

Our laws minimise the experiences of male victims.

### Rape

The 'rape' of males is considered less of a crime than the rape of females.

Under section 128 of the Crimes Act rape is defined as sexual connection with someone by the penetration of the victims genitalia by perpetrator's penis. Unlawful sexual connection covers other non-consensual sexual activity.

Although the crimes of rape and unlawful sexual connection have the same maximum sentence, judges guidance treats them very differently. The recommended sentence for rape, with no aggravating factors, is 6-8 years compared to 2-5 years for unlawful sexual connection.

Other issues arise from this legal definition.

-   Victims cannot technically call their experience rape.
-   Statistics for rape exclude male victims
-   Media reporting of male rape victims cannot call it rape. This makes it seem less severe.

> "I have not been penetrated without consent (I'm a straight male), but \[I\] have been made to penetrate someone else without my consent. What is that classified as? Because it's sex without consent but it doesn't fit under the definition of rape." (Pākehā, man, heterosexual, 21)[^39]

> --- "In Our Own Words" -- Student experiences of sexual violence prior to and during tertiary education. --Thursday's in Black

### **M**ale ass**aults** female

A specific crime of 'male assaults female' was introduced in Section 194 of the 1961 Crimes Act. 'Male assaults female' is equivalent to common assault however 'male assaults female' longer maximum sentence (2 years instead of 1 year) and does not fall under the 'bail of as right' provisions granted to persons charged with common assault.

In 2009 the Law Commission reviewed part eight of the Crimes Act[^40] and recommended repealing the 'male-assaults-female' offence.

The Family and Whānau Violence Legislation Bill addresses the limitations of using 'male assaults female' as a mechanism to address domestic violence. And made significant changes to the Crimes Act.

Despite the shortcomings of 'male assaults female' being addressed in the proposed bill and the ineffectiveness of using the law for symbolic purposes Amy Adams recommended not repealing male assaults female because of the symbolism. "Retaining the offence of male assaults female will ensure the law continues to acknowledge the seriousness of gendered violence even outside the context of family violence." [^41]

There were no objections to this and 'male assaults female' remains in the crimes act.

****If male victims are to have confidence in the government's family violence system the government needs to consider how their actions affect male victims. Unnecessarily retaining 'male assaults female'**** shows ****male victims they are less important than**** female victims ****to the government****.****

****The government must address these legal shortcomings.****

##  **C**ognitive bias

The new family violence system must take into account cognitive biases. Many studies find that people tend to have less empathy and concern for men's suffering compared to women's suffering.

This is why it is important to have diversity in the development of a family violence strategy and explicitly include male victims voices and needs.

#### Examples

Reynolds[^42] found

-   people tend to be more concerned about female suffering,
-   people think male suffering is more deserved or fair,
-   people are more motivated to punish men (see also, Jeffries[^43]).
-   These biases extend to group-level harm.

Follingstad found that "psychologists\... rated the husband\'s behavior as more likely to be psychologically abusive and more severe in nature than the wife\'s use of the same actions."[^44]

Cesario's "Results revealed that male victims of workplace sexual harassment were perceived less favorably than female victims were and were perceived as having suffered less than female victims did."[^45]

Savage found that both men and women are more sympathetic to female victims of partner violence than male victims[^46]

Agazue found bystanders are more sympathetic of female victims of physical assault than male victims.[^47]

> Gendered scenarios were found to be influential on explicit attitudes, with IPV less likely to be identified toward male victims and considered more acceptable compared to when the victim was female. Moreover, individuals reported feeling more capable and likely to intervene in an act of IPV when the victim was female compared to male, were more likely to report such an incident, and anticipated greater outcomes. **These findings highlight the need for an inclusive research approach that recognises men's victimisation.**

> Other empirical studies have confirmed that society has little sympathy for the male victims of intimate partner violence (Barber, 2008; Du Plat-Jones, 2006; Henning & Feder, 2004).

### Science bias

People are biased in their evaluations of science. This is exacerbates the issue of inadequate research on male victims.

> participants were more likely to believe the science when its conclusions aligned with prior understanding of their self, effects that were mediated through positive emotional reactions.

> Evaluations of science are robustly biased by identity concerns[^49]

Von Hipple[^50] investigated bias among social scientists and provides this insight:

> As one of our respondents wrote, "I found it curious how contradictory I was in responding! For instance, when science ostensibly reveals that the majority group has certain advantages, I say it's 'bad,' but when the minority group has certain advantages, I say it's 'good!'"

Likewise, Stewart-Williams[^51] found after viewing "a fictional popular-science article describing either a male-favouring or a female-favouring sex difference (i.e., men/women draw better; women/men lie more). Both sexes reacted less positively to the male-favouring differences, judging the findings to be less important, less credible, and more offensive, harmful, and upsetting."

# Recommendations:

1.  Create a position with the explicit and exclusive responsibility for improving outcomes for male victims. Including by

    a.  Identifying and removing systemic barriers facing male victims
    b.  Identify instances where secondary abuse can occur and reduce them
    c.  Providing expertise to the government regarding male victims.
    d.  Making public statements, media appearances, and other educational and awareness raising measures regarding male victims.
    e.  Listening to and consulting with male victims and their advocates.

2.  Explicitly, repeatedly and publicly proclaim the government's

    a.  commitment to support male victims; and
    b.  recognition of the unique experiences and challenges of male victims, including previous inadequacy of the system.

3.   Address laws that minimises male victims experiences.

    a.  amened the crimes act so rape is non-consensual sex, not penile penetration
    b.  repeal 'male assaults female'

4.  Commission research on the experiences of male victims using methods specifically designed to capture males experiences.

5.  Create a public awareness campaign for male victims, especially of female perpetrators.

6.  Ensure government websites providing information for victims explicitly identify the services that are available to male victims.

7.  Change the Ministry of Health guidelines to ask male patients about family violence as a matter of routine, not just when the doctor suspects victimisation.

8.  Explicitly include male victims voices, experiences and needs when training police, justice system officials, health workers, social services etc.

9.  Prohibit public servants from supporting White Ribbon in their official capacity.

10. Remove Duluth model, models based on the Duluth model from government policy and practice.
