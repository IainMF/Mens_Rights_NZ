## Introduction
Kia Ora,

I welcome this government’s courage to face the wicked problem of family and sexual violence.

The family and sexual violence system should work equally well for everybody. 166,000 men have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime and 230,000 men have experienced sexual violence in their lifetime[^1] These men deserve the best support and care we can give them.

Previous governments failed to give men that care. Male victims were excluded from the development of previous government's family and sexual violence system.

For example, our response to family violence is built on the 2003 NZ Violence Against Women (VAW) Study which excludes men by design:

> The prevalence statistics arising from the NZ VAW Study provided foundational information that has supported the work of the violence sector for the ensuing 17 years. The prevalence statistics continue to be widely used by government agencies, non-governmental organisations and the media, and have catalysed responses such as the establishment of the Family Violence: It’s Not OK Campaign.[^2] 

This has been a serious epistemological and moral problem.

Evidence-based policy is only effective with robust epistemology. Excluding men from the evidence base means our understanding of family and sexual violence is incomplete. Perhaps evidence from men’s experiences is the a critical piece for solving the puzzle.

More importantly, it is wrong make decisions that affect male victims without good data about male victims. Human rights advocates summarise it as “Nothing about us, without us”.

As the Family Violence Death Review Committee says, it is necessary “for services to take time to comprehend victims’ experiences”[^3] 

The Glenn Inquiry identified three important aspects for an effective family and sexual violence system.

For a system to work and be effective, the people using it and working in it must be able to:

* have trust that they will be respected and people will do the right things
* have faith that their needs will be recognised and met, and
* believe the people working in it are both compassionate and responsive.[^4] 

*The People’s Blueprint: Transforming the way we deal with child abuse and domestic violence in New Zealand*

So in the context of male victims:

* The system must show respect for male victims

* The system must show male victims that their needs are recognised and will be met

* The system must be compassionate and responsive to male victims.

Previous systems have not done those things.
