title: Ministry of Health Family Violence Complaint
description: A complaint about discrimination against men in the Ministry of Health's approach to family violence.
date: 2025-08-20
---
## My Complaint
1.  This is a complaint of unlawful discrimination and human rights violations against men concerning the Ministry of Health's *Violence Intervention Program* (VIP) and *Family Violence Assessment and Intervention Guideline*[^1] (the Guidelines). New Zealand has human rights obligations to prevent violence against men and treat men without discrimination.
### Human rights obligations

2.  The *New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990* affirms men's right to be free from discrimination[^2] and to be free from torture or cruel, degrading, or disproportionately severe treatment or punishment.[^3] Partner violence can meet the threshold for cruel or degrading treatment.

3.  The *Human Rights Act 1993* prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sex.[^4]

4.  The *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* (ICCPR) requires New Zealand to protect men from violence and discrimination. Article 2 prohibits discrimination against men in the application of covenant rights. Article 3 requires New Zealand to ensure that men enjoy their rights equally with women. Article 7 requires New Zealand to prevent cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, including domestic violence. Article 9 affirms everyone has the right to security of person. Article 26 requires New Zealand to provide equal and effective protection from discrimination to men.

5.  The *International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights* (ICESCR) also prohibits discrimination against men in the application of the covenant and requires New Zealand to ensure that men have equal enjoyment of their rights. Article 12 requires New Zealand to ensure that men have the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.

6.  The 2019 *Violence Intervention Program* evaluation identifies family violence as a human rights violation and highlights the importance of early intervention to prevent violence.

    > Internationally and within New Zealand, family violence is acknowledged as a human rights violation and a preventable public health problem ...Early identification of people subjected to violence followed by a supportive and effective response can improve safety and wellbeing. The health care system is an important point of entry for the multi-sectoral response to family violence, including both preventing violence and treating its consequences.[^5]
#### Due diligence

7.  New Zealand has the obligation to act with due diligence to protect[^6] men from rights violations by non-State actors. This includes protecting men from partner violence.

8.  ICCPR General Comment 31, paragraph 8 states:

    > \[T\]he positive obligations on States Parties to ensure Covenant rights will only be fully discharged if individuals are protected by the State, not just against violations of Covenant rights by its agents, but also against acts committed by private persons or entities that would impair the enjoyment of Covenant rights.

9.  ICESCR General Comment 16, paragraph 27 states:

    > States parties **must take appropriate measures to eliminate violence against men** and women and act with due diligence to prevent, investigate, mediate, punish and redress acts of violence against them by private actors. *Emphasis added*

10. "Due diligence should be understood as an obligation ...to prevent violence or violations of human rights, protect victims and witnesses from violations, investigate and punish those responsible, including private actors, and provide access to redress for human rights violations."[^7]

11. Under international human rights law, New Zealand must take all appropriate measures to protect men from partner violence and to ensure such measures are effective. New Zealand must also eliminate practices that tolerate or allow a negligent response to partner violence against men.[^8] New Zealand must not discriminate in the application of due diligence. That is, New Zealand must use the same level of commitment to address violence against men as they do with violence against women.[^9]
#### Justification of different treatment 

12. Health providers should treat women and men equally by default. Different treatment of women or men may be justified but must be based on reasonable and objective criteria and compatible with human rights treaties.

    ICPPR general comment 18, paragraph 13 states:

    > Finally, the Committee observes that not every differentiation of treatment will constitute discrimination, if the criteria for such differentiation are reasonable and objective and if the aim is to achieve a purpose which is legitimate under the Covenant.

    ICECSR general comment 20, paragraph 13 states:

    > Differential treatment based on prohibited grounds will be viewed as discriminatory unless the justification for differentiation is reasonable and objective. This will include an assessment as to whether the aim and effects of the measures or omissions are legitimate, compatible with the nature of the Covenant rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society. In addition, there must be a clear and reasonable relationship of proportionality between the aim sought to be realized and the measures or omissions and their effects. A failure to remove differential treatment on the basis of a lack of available resources is not an objective and reasonable justification unless every effort has been made to use all resources that are at the State party's disposition in an effort to address and eliminate the discrimination, as a matter of priority.
### Te Rito Family Violence Prevention Strategy

Te Rito was New Zealand's family violence prevention strategy at the time of development of the *VIP* and the *Guidelines*. Te Rito states that the government has a responsibility to ensure that men are protected from violence.

> **Principle 1:** All people have a fundamental right to be safe and to live free from violence
>
> The Government has a responsibility to ensure that all people in Aotearoa/New Zealand remain safe and free from violence. Consequently, family violence prevention initiatives must ensure that the safety and well-being of all victims are given paramount consideration.
### The Ministry's view of family violence

13. The Ministry emphasises the serious consequences of family violence and the importance of early intervention. The *Family Violence Assessment and Intervention Guidelines* state:

    > While any experience of violence can lead to immediate physical and mental health consequences, family violence can also have long-term health consequences. Violence occurring in families can, and often does, occur repeatedly over time, and is likely to involve multiple types of violence (ie, with combinations of physical, sexual and psychological violence co-occurring). These experiences are detrimental to health at all stages of the life course.[^10]
    >
    > ---

    > Early identification and intervention is important to minimise damage to all aspects of health as a result of abuse.[^11]
    >
    > ---

    > In addition, health care providers have ethical responsibilities to assist in early intervention and provide acute intervention for violent and abusive relationships.[^12]
    >
    > ---

    > ...it is no longer acceptable for us *not* to respond to an issue that is of fundamental importance to the health of New Zealanders.[^13] *Emphasis in original*

14. The guidelines state that health services must be proactive in ensuring victims receive support:

    > We know we can make a difference, and need to work proactively so that delivery of this programme continues to be robust and well supported.[^14]
### Ethics

15. The *Guidelines* highlight the important ethical considerations in responding to family violence. "The fundamental ethical principles which underpin all health care practice are relevant when guiding responses to violence and abuse."[^15] The Ministry has an ethical obligations to male victims of partner violence. These include the obligations *to do good*, and *to do no harm*.
### Violence Intervention Program 

16. The VIP discriminates against men and violates their human rights. The Family Violence Programme Logic (See Figure 1) does not include men as part of that logic. Subsequent discrimination occurs when men are not included in the VIP evaluation. The *2019 Violence Intervention Programme Evaluation* shows that men are excluded from the evaluation:[^16]

    > This evaluation sought to answer the following questions:
    >
    > 1.  How are New Zealand District Health Boards performing in terms of institutional support for family violence prevention?
    >
    > 2.  Is institutional change sustained over time?
    >
    > 3.  What is the rate of programme service delivery across District Health Boards?
    >
    > 4.  **How many women and children** are estimated to have received VIP assessment and intervention?
    >
    > *Emphasis added*

 ![[2019-VIP-Report-FINAL_web-version_1.png]]
Figure 1: Family Violence Programme Logic: *2019 Violence Intervention Programme Evaluation – page 74*

17. The Ministry has not met its due diligence obligations to effectively prevent violence against men. Due diligence requires understanding of the experience of male victims of family violence and the response of the health system to them. Appropriate support for male victims can only occur when good data about male victims and the health system's response are collected. The 2019 VIP evaluation identifies the importance of robust measurement:

    > What we measure influences how we view and respond to the problem. To date, VIP has focused on supporting health professionals. Better understanding of impact for service users...is overdue ...Without this understanding, we risk repeating unhelpful and potentially harmful responses to those seeking help in times of crisis ...As Bouckaert and Halligan note, 'the more quality that is taken into account, the more valid the performance measurement system will be'.[^17]

18. Collecting data on male victims and the health systems response is required regardless of whether the Ministry's guidelines recommend routine enquiry for men or not. There is no reasonable or objective reason to exclude men from VIP data collection.
### Family Violence Guidelines 

19. The *Guidelines* discriminate against male victims of family violence and impede New Zealand's human rights obligations to prevent violence against men. The *Guidelines* emphasise that \"\[r\]outine enquiry about intimate partner violence should be conducted with all females aged 16 years and older.\" However, for men \"\[r\]outine enquiry is not recommended\". Health professionals are recommended to wait until signs are present before asking men about partner violence. Health professionals following the guidelines provide an inferior service to men by denying them the benefits of routine enquiry.
#### Decision to do routine enquiry for women 

20. The *Guidelines* explain that the decision to conduct routine enquiry for women is based on the "health and ethical imperatives to respond to victims of IPV".

    > The World Health Organization (WHO) (2013) **recommended that routine enquiry about IPV should not be implemented**, however, they noted that the strength of this recommendation was 'conditional'. Key concerns raised were that, in many settings, there are insufficient resources available to respond to women who identify that they have experienced IPV, and the women find repeated enquiry difficult if no action is taken (WHO 2013). **However, given the efforts that have been made in New Zealand to establish appropriate referral options, and the health and ethical imperatives to respond to victims of IPV, routine enquiry about IPV among women is recommended in the current Guideline**.[^18]
    > *Emphasis added*

21. If the "health and ethical imperatives to respond to victims of IPV" require routine enquiry for women, then those the same imperatives must apply for men.
#### The Ministry's explanation 

22. The ministry explains its rationale for excluding men from routine enquiry for family violence.[^19]

    > **Why is there not routine enquiry for men regarding intimate partner violence?**
    >
    > The Family Violence Assessment and Intervention Guideline: Child abuse and intimate partner violence (Ministry of Health 2016) recommends that men aged 16 years and older be assessed if they present with signs and symptoms indicative of intimate partner violence.
    >
    > Routine enquiry is not recommended because of the differences in prevalence and severity of violence against men. Available data shows violence by women against their male partners tends to be less prevalent and less severe (Lievore and Mayhew 2006).
    >
    > A New Zealand study demonstrates that males who have been hit by females partners report needing no first aid, medical or hospital treatment compared with 9 percent of women who were hit by their male partners (Langley et al 1997).
    >
    > Kimmel (2002) acknowledges that prevalence rates of males reporting violence from partners may compare those reported by females. He also notes that perpetrators of systematic, persistent and serious violence are predominantly men.
### Shortcomings of the Guidelines 

23. International human rights law allows for differential treatment if it is reasonable and objective, and supports protection of human rights (See above). For example, a legitimate reason for health providers to avoid routine enquiry for men would be if the evidence shows routine enquiry results in poorer outcomes for men, their families and the wider community.

24. The Ministry's explanation for their position on routine enquiry for men is not aligned with New Zealand's human rights obligations. New Zealand's human rights obligation to prevent violence against men exists regardless of the frequency and severity of that violence. The Ministry's role in preventing violence is identifying victims and providing them with, or referring them to, services that can help them avoid further victimisation. Prevention requires early intervention so future violence can be avoided. Routine enquiry will result in earlier interventions than ad hoc enquiries.

25. Waiting until signs are present delays intervention and allows violence against men to continue and worsen. Delaying intervention can have a significant impact on victims and can increase costs to the health system.

26. Differences in prevalence and severity do not justify treating men less favourably. The Ministry must demonstrate that a difference in men's experience of partner violence requires different treatment.

27. Routine enquiry more important for men because lower rates of injury among male victims mean that they are less likely to shows signs of violence when meeting with a health professional. Male victims are at a disadvantage if health professionals only conduct enquires only when signs are present.

28. Routine enquires for men are more important because men do not engage with health services as often as women. Health professional's opportunity to intervene is reduced because they see men less frequently. Fewer men visit a GP in a year,[^20] and men visit doctors less often than women,[^21]. In addition, men are less likely to be in screening settings such as *Post-Natal Maternity*, *Sexual Health Services* or be care-givers in *Child Health In-patient*.

29. Identifying male victims is important not only for these men, but also for other family members. As noted in the guidelines, when violence is present in a family, often there are multiple victims.[^22] Identifying male victims gives the opportunity for health professionals to intervene to prevent children being victims of family violence.

30. The evidence on prevalence and severity is not as definitive as the *Guidelines* suggest. Population-based studies available in 2016, when the guidelines were written, show a significant number of male victims and a significant amount of severe violence directed at male victims (see [[Prevelance|Prevelance Studies]]). Studies released after the *Guidelines* also show significant victimisation among men.

31. Relying on the subjective judgment of a health professional to trigger a family violence enquiry will be biased against male victims because people, including psychologists,[^23] judge violence and abuse against men as less harmful than equivalent violence and abuse against women.[^24] [^25] [^26] [^27] [^28] [^29] [^30] People are less willing to intervene for a man who is a victim of a female perpetrator than when a women is the victim. Routine enquiry mitigates this cognitive bias.

32. Male victims of partner violence are less likely to seek help compared to female victims.[^31] [^32] Routine enquiry helps overcome some of the barriers men face in disclosing their victimisation. For example, men may not identify their experience as abuse or themselves as victims.[^33]

33. Research shows that men support routine screening for partner violence.

    > Rather than saying that men do not need to be screened for partner violence or that men would not respond well to these questions these men were overwhelmingly receptive to the idea of being asked very specific questions about partner violence in health care settings.[^34]

34. The Ministry's note that "perpetrators of systematic, persistent and serious violence are predominantly men" does not negate the Ministry's obligations to male victims. In fact, noting this in a section about male victims is likely to prejudice readers against male victims due to moral typecasting. When a group is seen as a perpetrators, it is hard for people to see them as victims.[^35]

35. Furthermore, restricting routine enquiry to women means that health professionals may filter out people identifying as a non-binary gender for routine enquiry.
### Harm done

36. The current implementation of the *Violence Intervention Programme* has caused harm to male victims of partner violence by:

    -   Minimising and obscuring male victims, reducing the likely likelihood of early intervention and prevention of further abuse.

    -   Failing to collect data on male victims prevents an informed and appropriate response to male victims.

    -   Supporting myths and stereotypes about male victims that create barriers for them.

    The *Family Violence Intervention Guidelines* have caused harm:

    -   Health providers following the guidelines provide an inferior service to men.

    -   The lack of routine enquiry means that male victims of partner abuse have not been identified and therefore cannot access appropriate services.

    -   Early intervention and prevention of further violence or abuse has not occurred because routine enquiry is not done for men.

    -   The collection of robust data and statistics to understand the needs and experience of male victims is not possible when routine enquiry is not done. Sampling bias is significant when health professionals only conduct enquiries when they see signs of family violence.
### Remedy

37. Under the ICCPR and the ICESCR, New Zealand is required to provide an effective remedy to men whose rights have been violated. An effective remedy includes public apologies,[^36] ending ongoing violations,[^37] preventing recurrences of violations,[^38] repairing harm that as be done at the earliest possible opportunity.[^39]

38. To remedy the harm done by the Ministry's actions, the Ministry should:

    -   Issue a public apology to men for the VIP and the Guidelines.

    -   Update the VIP Programme Logic to **explicitly include both women and men** and include an explanation of the change.

    -   Update VIP programme evaluations to count:

        -   The number of IPV enquiries conducted with men; and

        -   The number male victims of IPV; and

        -   The number and type of IPV referrals for male victims.

    -   Update the Family Violence Intervention Guidelines:

        -   to recommend routine enquiry of family violence victimisation for males aged 16 or older; and

        -   explain the change in policy in the guidelines; and

        -   Provide support and education for health professionals on the issues for male victims of partner and family violence.
## Response

Tēnā koe Iain

Thank you for your detailed correspondence dated 20 August 2025 regarding the Ministry of Health’s Violence Intervention Programme (VIP) and the Family Violence Assessment and Intervention Guidelines. We appreciate your engagement and the time you have taken to raise concerns about the programme’s focus and its implications for male victims of family violence.

We acknowledge the human rights principles you have outlined, including those in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, the Human Rights Act 1993, and international covenants such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Health New Zealand | Te Whatu Ora (Health NZ)
is committed to upholding these obligations and ensuring that all individuals - regardless of gender - are treated with dignity and respect and have access to appropriate health services.

### Rationale for VIP focus on women and children
The VIP was developed in response to extensive evidence showing that women and children disproportionately experience the most severe and persistent forms of family violence. This includes physical, sexual, and psychological abuse, often with long-term health consequences. The programme’s design reflects the need for a targeted response to address this significant public
health issue. 

Key considerations include:

1. **Prevalence and Severity of Harm:** While men can and do experience partner violence, the evidence consistently shows that women are more likely to experience repeated, severe, and coercive forms of abuse. For example, the New Zealand Family Violence Study (2019) found that women were significantly more likely than men to experience sexual violence and psychological abuse from intimate partners. The health consequences for women - especially in reproductive and maternal health settings - are profound and require tailored responses.
2. **Health Sector Entry Points:** The VIP, which also encompasses child abuse and neglect, is integrated across various health services settings, including sexual health, and child health services. These settings provide critical opportunities for early identification and intervention.
3. **Ethical and Clinical Imperatives**: Routine enquiry for women is recommended based on ethical obligations to do good and prevent harm, and because women are more likely to benefit from early identification due to the nature and frequency of their interactions with health services. For men, enquiry is recommended when signs or symptoms are present, ensuring that support is available without overextending limited resources in settings where routine enquiry may not be clinically justified.
4. **Resource allocation and programme effectiveness:** Health NZ must ensure that interventions are evidence-based and proportionate to the scale and severity of the issue. While differential treatment must be justified, it is not discriminatory when based on objective criteria and aimed at achieving legitimate public health outcomes. The current approach reflects this balance.
5. **Commitment to continuous improvement:** We acknowledge that male victims of family violence face unique barriers to disclosure and support. Health NZ is committed to improving data collection, training, and service responsiveness to ensure male victims are not overlooked. We will continue to review the Guidelines and VIP evaluation frameworks to ensure they reflect evolving evidence and uphold the rights of all individuals.

Your feedback will be considered as part of the ongoing programme development and evaluation.

Thank you for taking the time to write, and for your advocacy to ensure that all victims of family violence receive the support they need. I hope this information is useful, and I wish you well.

Nāku noa, nā

From: Iain Fergusson 

To: Deborah Woodley -- Director, Starting Well -- Planning, Funding & Outcomes `info@health.govt.nz`

Tēnā koe,

1.  Thank you for your response (HNZ00096554) to my discrimination complaint about the *Violence Intervention Programme* (VIP) and *Family Violence Assessment and Intervention Guidelines*. Unfortunately, I am not satisfied. New Zealand has a human rights obligation to prevent and protect men from violence. The needs of male victims must be taken into account in the development, implementation, and evaluation of violence prevention measures.

2.  This letter contains questions at the end that are an OIA request.

## Following the Guidelines 

3.  The Health New Zealand website[^41] says that the VIP must align with National Guidelines, which recommend enquiry for men if there are signs and symptoms present. Health New Zealand's example Intimate Partner Violence Intervention Policy[^42] states that "The Ministry of Health's Family Violence Assessment and Intervention Guideline guides this policy". If the VIP is to follow the Guidelines, then it must include men.

4.  There is no reasonable or objective reason to exclude men from the VIP programme logic. Excluding men from the programme logic does not support legitimate public health or human rights outcomes. Men's needs should have been considered in the programme development and reflected in the programme logic to align with the Guidelines and with New Zealand's human rights obligations. For example, the programme logic could have included the following:

    -   Screening questions asked of women
    -   Enquiry with men when signs are present
    -   Clinical assessment of child abuse

5.  The Guidelines, and the VIP policy example include non-routine enquiry for men. There is no reasonable or objective reason to exclude men's enquiries from data collection and the programme evaluation. Excluding male victims from data collection and programme evaluation does not support legitimate public health or human rights outcomes. If Health New Zealand is going to base it's policy on evidence, *it must collect the evidence about men in the VIP evaluation*. Including non-routine enquiry for men in reporting and evaluation would not have created an unreasonable drain on resources.

## Limited resources

6.  Even if including men in VIP programme logic and evaluation did require significant resources, that is not an excuse for discrimination. In international human rights law having limited resources is not a valid excuse for discrimination:

    > A failure to remove differential treatment on the basis of a lack of available resources is not an objective and reasonable justification unless every effort has been made to use all resources that are at the State party's disposition in an effort to address and eliminate the discrimination, as a matter of priority.[^43]

## Routine enquiry

7.  Reasons for a targeted programme for women do not negate New Zealand's health, ethical, and human rights obligations to men. New Zealand must demonstrate that it has taken the necessary steps to prevent violence and protect male victims, and that these steps meet New Zealand's health, ethical and human rights obligations.

8.  In your response, you say "\[f\]or men, enquiry is recommended when signs or symptoms are present, **ensuring that support is available**". However, there is nothing in your response to indicate that men, are, in fact, receiving support.

### The ineffectiveness of men's screening

9.  International research shows formal support services do not work well for male victims of partner violence.[^44] [^45] Therefore, if New Zealand's support systems for male victims are similar to international models, it is reasonable to assume they are also ineffective and require remedial action to address the shortcomings.

10. In New Zealand, Higgins[^46] studied partner violence screening in a New Zealand General Practice that used the Ministry's Guidelines. The study provides data on the effectiveness of screening for women and men. In the study, 54% of females were screened, 13% of them reported that they had experienced partner violence at some point in their lives. 9.7% of males were screened, only 1.3% of them reported that they had experienced partner violence at some point in their lives. 7.2% of all female patients and 0.12% of all male patients reported partner violence.[^47]

11. Population based-studies report similar lifetime experience of partner violence. The New Zealand Family Violence Study, which you reference in your response, shows that 28% of women and 29.4% of men report lifetime experience of partner violence. In the New Zealand Crime and Victims Survey,[^48] 23.6% of women and 10% of men report lifetime experience of partner violence.

12. These studies suggest that men are between 30--50% of the victims of partner violence. If the screening for men was as effective as the routine screening for women the study would have found between 3--7.2% of men were victims, rather than finding just 0.12%. **Therefore, it is clear that the recommended screening for men is ineffective in identifying male victims**.

13. The ineffectiveness of screening when only signs and symptoms are present was highlighted in the Ministry's 2002 *Family Violence Intervention Guidelines*[^49] It explains that screening women based on signs and symptoms is as ineffective at identifying victims as relying on women to voluntarily disclose abuse. Both result in approximately 2% of abused women being found. The 2002 Guidelines argue that this low rate of detection for women is not acceptable and recommends routine screening. Higgins' study showed signs-and-symptoms screening was similarly ineffective in detecting male victims.

### Due diligence and burden of proof 

14. New Zealand must exercise due diligence to ensure that violence prevention measures are effective for men. The Ministry carries the burden to proof[^50] to show that omitting men from the VIP programme logic and evaluation is not discriminatory. The Ministry also has to show that non-routine enquiry for men is not discrimination. It must show that it is necessary, reasonable, and proportionate and supports the goal of reducing violence and supporting victims.

15. If you could show that male victims are being identified at rates that are proportional to population-based studies, and they are receiving the support they need, that would show that the VIP and Guidelines are not discriminating against men.

## An analogy

16. Men die from suicide at approximately 3 times the rate of women. This difference in prevalence and severity might justify a targeted suicide reduction program for men, but a suicide reduction program can't ignore female suicide. Data collected about the suicide reduction program should not just collect data about men; women must be included.

17. Different risk factors between men and women may require different approaches to reduce suicides, but the each approach should be effective. Women being the minority of suicides does not justify an ineffective programme for women.

## Questions

18. These questions are an OIA request and should be read in the context of my previous letter of complaint, your response and this letter.

    1.  Please clarify whether the *Violence Intervention Programme* isa targeted programme to address violence against women andchildren, or a programme to implement the *Family ViolenceAssessment and Intervention Guidelines* which includes men? 
    
    3.  How does excluding men from VIP programme logic and evaluation support 'legitimate public health outcomes'?

    4.  What systems are in place to ensure that health professionals are following the Guidelines on male victims?

    5.  You say that 'male victims of family violence face uniquebarriers to disclosure and support'. What has Health New Zealand done to identify and address these barriers?

    6.  What evidence do you have that male victims are receiving the support they need from the health system?

Ngā Mihi,

Iain Fergusson
