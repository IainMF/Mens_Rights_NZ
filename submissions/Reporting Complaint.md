title: Complaint about UN reporting
description: A complaint of discrimination against men in New Zealand's United Nations human rights reporting.
date: 2025-08-20
---


## To: The Ministry of Justice 

1.  This is a complaint of unlawful discrimination and other rights violations for omitting men's human rights issues when reporting on article 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and article 3 the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). In this complaint, article 3 of both conventions are referred to collectively as **article 3** because article 3 of both conventions are substantially the same and this complaint applies to both conventions.

2.  Article 3 of the ICCPR states:

    > The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil and political rights set forth in the present Covenant.

3.  Article 3 of the ICESCR states:

    > The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights set forth in the present Covenant.

4.  ICCPR General Comment 28, paragraph 2, makes it clear that article 3 applies to both men and women.

    > Article 3 implies that all human beings should enjoy the rights provided for in the Covenant, on an equal basis and in their totality.

5.  ICESCR General Comment 16, paragraph 6, makes it clear that article 3 applies to both men and women.

    > The essence of article 3 of ICESCR is that the rights set forth in the Covenant are to be enjoyed by men and women on a basis of equality, a concept that carries substantive meaning. While expressions of formal equality may be found in constitutional provisions, legislation and policies of Governments, article 3 also mandates the equal enjoyment of the rights in the Covenant for men and women in practice.

6.  New Zealand's reports to the United Nations omitted reporting on men's enjoyment of their rights under article 3, often relying on New Zealand's reports on the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). This is discrimination against men.

# Reporting obligations 

## ICCPR 

7.  New Zealand is required to report to the United Nations Human Rights Committee on the ICCPR. Article 40.1 of the ICCPR states:

    > 1.  The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to submit reports on the measures they have adopted which give effect to the rights recognized herein and on the progress made in the enjoyment of those rights:
    >
    >     1.  Within one year of the entry into force of the present Covenant for the States Parties concerned;
    >
    >     2.  Thereafter whenever the Committee so requests.

8.  Article 2.2 of the ICCPR requires New Zealand to "take the necessary steps...to give effect to the rights recognized in the present Covenant". Monitoring and reporting are necessary to give effect to the rights of the Covenant.
#### Consolidated Guidelines for State reports under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 

9.  The United Nations Human Rights Committee published guidelines for reporting under the ICCPR in 1999[^1] and a revision in 2001.[^2] Section C contains general guidance on the contents of all reports. The relevant parts are:

    > 4.  **Factors and difficulties.** Article 40 of the Covenant requires that factors and difficulties, if any, affecting the implementation of the Covenant should be indicated. A report should explain the nature and extent of, and reasons for every such factor and difficulty, if any such exist; and should give details of the steps being taken to overcome these.
    >
    > 5.  **Data and statistics.** A report should include sufficient data and statistics to enable the Committee to assess progress in the enjoyment of Covenant rights, relevant to any appropriate article.
    >
    > 6.  **Article 3.** The situation regarding the equal enjoyment of Covenant rights by men and women should be specifically addressed.

10. New Zealand's reports do not contain sufficient data and statistics to assess compliance with article 3. New Zealand's article 3 reporting does not address men's equal enjoyment of their rights. The reports do not address the factors and difficulties in implementing article 3 in relation to men's rights.
#### General Comments 

11. ICCPR General Comment 18 says that New Zealand's article 3 reporting should include discrimination against men, in fact, and the measures taken to address such discrimination.

    > Reports of many States parties contain information regarding legislative as well as administrative measures and court decisions which relate to protection against discrimination in law, but they very often lack information which would reveal discrimination in fact. When reporting on articles 2 (1), 3 and 26 of the Covenant, States parties usually cite provisions of their constitution or equal opportunity laws with respect to equality of persons. While such information is of course useful, the Committee wishes to know if there remain any problems of discrimination in fact, which may be practised either by public authorities, by the community, or by private persons or bodies. The Committee wishes to be informed about legal provisions and administrative measures directed at diminishing or eliminating such discrimination.[^3]

12. New Zealand's article 3 reporting does not address discrimination against men in law or in fact.
### ICESCR 

13. New Zealand is required to report to the United Nations Economic and Social Council on ICESCR. Article 16.1 of the ICECSR states:

    > The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to submit in conformity with this part of the Covenant reports on the measures which they have adopted and the progress made in achieving the observance of the rights recognized herein.[^4]

    Article 17.2 requires New Zealand to report "factors and difficulties":

    > Reports may indicate factors and difficulties affecting the degree of fulfilment of obligations under the present Covenant.[^5]
#### General Comments 

14. ICESCR General Comment 16 requires periodic review of State obligations under Article 3

    > States parties should periodically review existing legislation, policies, strategies and programmes in relation to economic, social and cultural rights, and adopt any necessary changes to ensure that they are consonant with their obligations under article 3 of the Covenant.[^6]

15. New's Zealand has not conducted a review to ensure it's "legislation, policies, strategies and programmes" are consonant with it's article 3 obligations to men. New Zealand's article 3 reporting does not cover measures to ensure men equally enjoy their rights, nor the factors and difficulties in ensuring this obligation.
## Best Practice 

16. New Zealand has not followed best practice in monitoring and reporting on human rights issues with respect to men and boys.
#### Declaration on Human Rights Defenders 

    The Declaration on Human Rights Defenders says that New Zealand has a responsibility to promote men's understanding of their rights. New Zealand's omission of men's rights under article 3 neglects this responsibility.

    > Article 14
    >
    > 1.  The State has the responsibility to take legislative, judicial, administrative or other appropriate measures to promote the understanding by all persons under its jurisdiction of their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.
    >
    > 2.  Such measures shall include, inter alia:
    >
    >     1.  The publication and widespread availability of national laws and regulations and of applicable basic international human rights instruments;
    >
    >     2.  Full and equal access to international documents in the field of human rights, including the periodic reports by the State to the bodies established by the international human rights treaties to which it is a party, as well as the summary records of discussions and the official reports of these bodies.
#### Manual on Human Rights Monitoring 

17. The *Manual on Human Rights Monitoring*[^7] recommends using a gender perspective to ensure that all violations against women *and men* are recognised and accounted for:

    > Integrating a gender perspective in human rights monitoring is a process to ensure that all violations against men and women of all ages and sections of society are recognized and accounted for. It is also a strategy for making women's **as well as men's experiences and concerns an integral dimension of the design and implementation of the monitoring cycle**. It helps to better understand the causes and types of human rights violations and, hence, the measures required for prevention and protection. *Emphasis added*

18. The *Manual* says that New Zealand should be proactive about including men's rights issues and New Zealand should make men's rights issues visible in reports.

    > Integrating gender implies a **proactive** attitude of looking at and analysing how situations affect women, girls, men and boys differently. It is also about making such differences **visible** throughout the monitoring cycle. *Emphasis in original*

19. New Zealand has not been proactive in reporting on men's rights under article 3 and men's rights are not visible in New Zealand's article 3 reporting.
#### Integrating a Gender Perspective into Statistics 

20. *Integrating a Gender Perspective into Statistics* says that monitoring methods "must be developed in such a way as to ensure that the diversity of various groups of women and men and their specific activities and challenges are captured."[^8] New Zealand's monitoring of article 3 has not captured men's specific challenges.
#### Human Rights Based Approach to Data 

21. *A Human Rights-Based Approach to Data* (HRBAD)[^9] recommends collecting and reporting disaggregated data. This should include sex disaggregated data on article 3, including both men's and women enjoyment of their rights. In addition, HRBAD states that data and reports should be useful to the population groups they represent. New Zealand's reports have not been useful to men and boys in advocating for their rights.
## New Zealand's article 3 reporting 

22. New Zealand's article 3 reporting does not include men's human rights issues. Often, New Zealand relies on its *Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women* (CEDAW) reports to cover its article 3 reporting. CEDAW is self-evidently inadequate for reporting on men's enjoyment of their rights under article 3.
#### ICCPR 

23. New Zealand's 1994 report covers women's issues and omits men's issues under the heading of article 3. Paragraph 25 refers the reader to New Zealand's CEDAW report for a "comprehensive account".

    > The New Zealand Government has recently submitted its second report on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The CEDAW report, a copy of which is supplied as annex I, provides a **comprehensive account** of the status of women in New Zealand, and will provide much information of the kind sought by the Human Rights Committee on this subject in written and oral questions on the occasion of the presentation of New Zealand's second report in 1989.[^10] *Emphasis added*

24. Paragraph 71 of New Zealand's 2001 report describes New Zealand's article 3 reporting as being "comprehensively covered" by its 1998 CEDAW report on women's rights. Men's issues are omitted.

    > Developments in the equal rights of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil and political rights during the report period are **comprehensively covered** by New Zealand's combined Third and Fourth Report to the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women submitted in February 1998 (CEDAW/C/New Zealand'sL/3-4) [^11] *Emphasis added*

25. Paragraph 89 of New Zealand's 2008 report explains that its CEDAW report "comprehensively covers" New Zealand's article 3 obligations. Men's issues are omitted.

    > New Zealand's Sixth Report to the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), submitted in March 2006 (CEDAW/C/NZL/6), **comprehensively covers** developments relating to the equal rights of men and women to enjoyment of all civil and political rights during the last report period.[^12] *Emphasis added*

26. In 2015, New Zealand relied on CEDAW to cover its article 3 reporting. Men's issues are omitted.

    > Developments in the equal rights of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil and political rights during the report period in Tokelau are covered by Appendix Three of New Zealand's Seventh Periodic Report to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW/C/NZ/7).[^13]
#### WEF Gender gap report 

27. Similarly, New Zealand has relied on the World Economic Forum's *Global Gender Gap Report* when assessing its article 3 obligations. New Zealand's 2008 ICCPR report states:

    > The international comparative Global Gender Gap Report, published by the World Economic Forum, measures economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival and political empowerment. **The report is an authoritative benchmark of New Zealand's progress in ensuring equal rights for men and women**.[^14] *Emphasis added*

28. The *Gender Gap Report* is insufficient for assessing compliance with article 3 because the index obscures the gaps where men are disadvantaged compared to women. The *Gender Gap Report* truncates data so that areas where men are disadvantaged are counted as 'equality'.

    > Hence, the Index rewards countries that reach the point where outcomes for women equal those for men, **but it neither rewards nor penalizes the cases where women have advantage over men in particular variables**.[^15] *Emphasis added*
#### ICESCR 

29. New Zealand's second ICESCR report refers to a CEDAW report for further information on article 3 obligations:

    > New Zealand is a State party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and presented its combined third and fourth periodic reports there under to the relevant Committee, covering the period up to early 1998, in July 1998...For further information with respect to equal rights for men and women and limitations faced in the realization of these rights, reference should be made to the above report...[^16]

30. New Zealand's third report refers to CEDAW when reporting on article 3 and omits men's rights:

    > New Zealand is a State Party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). New Zealand submitted its fifth periodic CEDAW report in 2002 and its sixth periodic report in 2006. The two periodic reports cover the period from March 1998 to March 2006.[^17]

31. NZ's fourth ICESCR report only includes information about women under the heading of article 3. Although this is a response to the *List of Issues* which does not include any issues for men under article 3.
## Insufficient reporting 

32. New Zealand's article 3 reporting is deficient because it does not include human rights issues for men. Specifically, the problems of New Zealand's article 3 reporting are:

    -   It relies on New Zealand's CEDAW reports to cover article 3. This is inadequate because article 3 includes men's human rights while the CEDAW reports do not.

    -   It does not provide sufficient data on men and boys for the United Nations to assess compliance with article 3;

    -   It does not include the factors and difficulties affecting the implementation of article 3 with regard to men and boys;

    -   It does not include discrimination against men in law or in fact;

    -   It has not been based on a review its legislation, policies, strategies and programmes to ensure they are consonant to their article 3 obligations to men and boys;

    -   It does not make men's human rights issues visible in the monitoring cycle;

    -   It is not useful for men and men's advocates.
## Rights violated by not reporting 
### The right to be free from discrimination 
#### Domestic Law 

33. The right to be free from discrimination is affirmed in Section 19 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The Human Rights Act 1993 prohibits discrimination against men by the government.

34. Omitting men's human rights issues when reporting on article 3 is discrimination. The men and boys of New Zealand rely on the government to represent them before the United Nations. The government provides an inferior service when representing men's human rights compared to representing women's human rights.

35. ICESCR General Comment 20 states that New Zealand's laws should be interpreted to give men full protection of their rights. "Domestic legal guarantees of equality and non-discrimination should be interpreted by these institutions in ways which facilitate and promote the full protection of economic, social and cultural rights."[^18]
#### International Law 

36. Article 2.1 of the ICCPR requires New Zealand to respect and ensure civil and political rights without distinction of any kind.

37. > \[The Human Rights\] Committee believes that the term "discrimination" as used in the Covenant should be understood to imply any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference which is based on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, and which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing, of all rights and freedoms.[^19]

38. Article 2.2 of the ICESCR similarly prohibits discrimination:

    > Non-discrimination is an immediate and cross-cutting obligation in the Covenant. Article 2, paragraph 2, requires States parties to guarantee non-discrimination in the exercise of each of the economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in the Covenant and can only be applied in conjunction with these rights. It is to be noted that discrimination constitutes any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference or other differential treatment that is directly or indirectly based on the prohibited grounds of discrimination and which has the intention or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of Covenant rights. Discrimination also includes incitement to discriminate and harassment.[^20]

39. Omitting men's rights under article 3 is discrimination because it impairs the recognition of men's rights on an equal footing with women.

40. Article 26 of the ICCPR requires New Zealand to provide **equal and effective** protection against discrimination.

    > Article 26 not only entitles all persons to equality before the law as well as equal protection of the law but also prohibits any discrimination under the law and guarantees to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.[^21]

41. Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that men are entitled to equal protection from discrimination.

    > All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.

42. Reporting on article 3 for women, but not for men, does not provide equal and effective protection from discrimination for men and boys.
### The right to equal enjoyment of rights 

43. According to ICCPR and ICESCR, New Zealand must "take the necessary steps" to ensure that men enjoy all their rights, including the right to the equal enjoyment of their rights. Reporting on men's human rights under article 3 is a necessary step to ensure that men enjoy all their rights on an equal basis with women.
### The right to receive information 

44. Section 14 of the Bill of Rights Act 1990 affirms that "\[e\]veryone has the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and opinions of any kind in any form."

45. Men have a right to receive information about their human rights issues and the government's response. Reporting on women's rights under article 3 provides women with information about their rights. Omitting men's human rights issues when reporting on article 3 denies men that same right.
## Harm done 

46. The lack of reporting on men's rights issues under article 3 harms men and the protection of their rights. New Zealand must "endeavour to repair at the earliest possible opportunity any harm that may have been caused by such violations"[^22]
#### Increased vulnerability to violations 

47. Inadequate monitoring and reporting make men more vulnerable to human rights violations because decision makers cannot respond to issues they are unaware of. The United Nations committees cannot make recommendations for issues that are absent from the reports. Violations have gone unrecognised, increasing the likelihood of further violations.
#### Perpetuates discrimination against men 

48. Discrimination against men has not been identified and rectified because New Zealand has not reported on men's issues under article 3. If New Zealand had comprehensively reported on men's issues under article 3, then this discrimination would have been identified and addressed. For example, New Zealand maintains laws that explicitly discriminate against men in violation of the ICCPR, like Section 194 of the Crimes Act 1961 (*male-assaults-female*) and Section 178 of the Crimes Act 1961 (*infanticide*).

49. Furthermore, New Zealand's omission men's rights in its reports provides tacit approval for others to discriminate against men in a similar manner. It appears normal to omit men's rights issues from public discussion of human rights. Conversely, if men's rights issues were fully included in New Zealand's reporting public discussion of men's rights issues would be seen as a normal part of human rights conversations, allowing them to be addressed.
#### Undermines men advocating for themselves 

50. New Zealand men have not been able to effectively advocate for themselves and hold the government to account for violations of their rights. Men need accurate and easily accessible information on their human rights issues and the government response. New Zealand's omission of men's rights under article 3 denies them this information.

51. United Nation's committees have not been fully informed and therefore cannot make appropriate recommendations to address men's human rights issues. This undermines men's ability to hold the government accountable for violations of their rights.

    The *Declaration on Human Rights Defenders* Article 14.1 states that New Zealand has a responsibility to promote men's understanding of their rights. New Zealand has not done this.

    > The State has the responsibility to take legislative, judicial, administrative or other appropriate measures to promote the understanding by all persons under its jurisdiction of their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.[^23]
#### Reinforces myths and stereotypes 

52. Omitting men's human rights issues under article 3 reinforces harmful myths and stereotypes for both women and men. For example, it perpetuates the myth that article 3 is about women's rights, rather than about both women's and men's rights. Each time article 3 is treated as being about women rights, the myth is perpetuated.

53. Another myth that New Zealand's reporting has perpetuated is that women are uniquely disadvantaged and men have few problems. New Zealand's article 3 reporting relies on CEDAW reports that total 770 pages to date. With no equivalent describing men's rights, an uninformed observer would conclude that women have many human rights issues and men have few. However, this is an artefact of the bias in reporting, not the reality of the situation.
#### Prevents recognition of men as rights-holders 

54. Similarly, the bias in reporting creates the impression that the government does not have obligations to men as rights-holders. Recognising the government's obligations to men and boys is essential to addressing their human rights issues. Disaggregated statistics must be understood in light of New Zealand's human rights obligations to men and boys under article 3 and other articles.[^24] Omitting men's issues under article 3 means that men are not recognised as full rights-holders.
## Remedy 

55. Article 2.3 of the ICCPR requires New Zealand to provide an 'effective remedy' for violations of the covenant's rights.

    > International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Article 2, paragraph 3, requires that in addition to effective protection of Covenant rights States Parties must ensure that individuals also have accessible and effective remedies to vindicate those rights...Cessation of an ongoing violation is an essential element of the right to an effective remedy.[^25]

56. Similarly, ICESCR requires New Zealand "\[t\]o make available and accessible appropriate remedies, such as compensation, reparation, restitution, rehabilitation, guarantees of non-repetition, declarations, public apologies, educational programmes and prevention programmes"[^26]

57. ICESCR General Comment 16 specifically addresses providing remedy for violations of article 3.

    > National policies and strategies should provide for the establishment of effective mechanisms and institutions where they do not exist, including administrative authorities, ombudsmen and other national human rights institutions, courts and tribunals. **These institutions should investigate and address alleged violations relating to article 3 and provide remedies for such violations. States parties, for their part, should ensure that such remedies are effectively implemented.**[^27] *Emphasis added*

58. Remedy requires reparation, such as "restitution, rehabilitation and measures of satisfaction, such as public apologies, public memorials, guarantees of non-repetition and changes in relevant laws and practices, as well as bringing to justice the perpetrators of human rights violations".[^28] [^29]
### The Remedies 
#### Public Apology 

59. The appropriate Minister should make a public apology before parliament. The apology should admit discrimination against men by omitting men's human rights issues under article 3. It should describe the actions taken to correct the lack of reporting and to ensure that men's human rights are fully reported in the future.
#### Investigation 

60. The government should commission an independent investigation to determine why men's rights issues have been omitted in its article 3 reporting. The investigation should make recommendations for policy changes to ensure that men's rights issues are fully included in future reports.
#### Policy changes to ensure men's rights are monitored and reported in the future 

61. The Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign affairs and Trade and other government departments responsible for monitoring and reporting human rights should implement a policy that ensures that men's rights are fully monitored and reported. The policy should address that men lack the regular monitoring and reporting cycle that CEDAW provides for women.

62. Article 3 is a cross-cutting obligation, so the policy of fully including men's issues in reports should apply to all human rights reporting.
#### Supplementary reports 

63. The government should produce supplementary reports covering men's equal enjoyment of their rights under article 3 for both the ICCPR and the ICESCR. Each report should be submitted to the relevant United Nations Committee.

64. Reports should focus on the inequalities faced by men and boys in the enjoyment of their rights, and *how the government is addressing these issues*. Reports should include developments and issues for the period in which New Zealand's reports did not include men in their article 3 reporting. The reports should explain why men's human rights issues were not included in previous reports.

65. The reports should include the factors and difficulties that affect the implementation of the Conventions relating to men's rights and article 3 in particular. The "report should explain the nature and extent of, and reasons for every such factor and difficulty, if any such exist; and should give details of the steps being taken to overcome these."[^30]

66. The reports should be available and accessible to government decision makers and the general public.

67. The reports should include:

    -   Performance of men and boys in education, including:

        -   Reading and literacy of primary and secondary students

        -   NCEA results, especially when boys are over-represented in lower attainment

        -   Suspensions, expulsions, and other disciplinary actions taken against students

        -   Years of schooling

        -   University enrolment and attainment

        -   Number of people with, and type of, degree

    -   The experience of men in the justice system, including:

        -   Police use of force more likely against men (TASERs)

        -   Police decisions to prosecute is often biased against men

        -   Sentencing disparities that give men longer sentences

        -   Treatment of men in prison (including fathers)

        -   Disparities in number of people in prison

    -   Men's Health

        -   Lack of a health strategy for men and boys

        -   Higher male suicide rate and prevention efforts to reduce male suicide

        -   Higher rates of amenable mortality among men, including injury, and efforts to reduce.

        -   Prostate cancer & other male-specific or male overrepresented issues

        -   Health spending on men's health

    -   Discriminatory laws, such as:

        -   The prohibition of FGM but not circumcision

        -   Male-assaults-female - Section 194 of the Crimes Act 1961

        -   Infanticide - Section 178 of the Crimes Act 1961

        -   Section 4(2) of the Adoption Act 1955

        -   The Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Act 2022 requires a women's health strategy but no equivalent for men.

    -   Violence and support for male victims, including;

        -   The prevalence, incidence, and severity of violence against men, including:

            -   Homicides

            -   Assaults causing severe injury

        -   How many shelters and other support available for male victims of family and other violence

        -   How many men are accessing support

        -   The existence and effectiveness of public awareness campaigns for male victims, including issues like:

            -   Male victims not fully included in the "It's Not Okay" campaign.

            -   The Ministry of Health recommends that doctors do not screen males for family violence as a matter of routine.

    -   Systems in place to protect men's rights and their effectiveness, for example:

        -   BORA Section 7

        -   Gender analysis of cabinet papers

        -   Complaints of discrimination against men made to the Human Rights Commission

    -   Men's treatment in family matters and family court

    -   Difficulties and disparities in ensuring men's rights

        -   The system's in place to ensuring women's rights do not have an equivalent for men

            -   There is no minister for men, or ministry for men

            -   Lack of jurisprudence for men's rights such as, CEDAW, Beijing Platform for action etc.

        -   The misunderstanding among public servants that article 3 and gender equality is about women rather than both women and men.
#### Education and public awareness 

68. The ICCPR and the ICESCR require New Zealand to address any conditions and attitudes that cause or perpetuate discrimination against men.[^31] [^32]

69. The government should educate public servants about their obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of men and boys.[^33] This should include education on the cross-cutting nature of article 3 and how it relates to the other covenant articles.

70. The government should have public awareness campaigns to highlight discrimination against men and boys. This will increase public involvement, which will allow the government to be more informed during its reporting process.
#### Ensure common core document includes issues for men and boys 

71. New Zealand should ensure that its common core document[^34] adequately and accurately represents men's human rights issues and does not reinforce stereotypes. For example, the education section in the current document does not include sex disaggregated data that would show disparities affecting men and boys.
