## What are men's rights?

Men's rights are the human rights issues that *uniqely* or *predominately* affecte men and/or boys.

Men's unique human rights issues are ones that affect men *becuase they are men*. This can be because men are biologically different from women, which can lead to unique issues such as paternity fraud, or it can be because law and practice discriminate against men. 

There are also human rights issues that affect men significantly more than women. for example, men are aproximatley 75% of suicide deaths, over 90% of prisoners, and have higher rates of preventable and treatable mortality.
