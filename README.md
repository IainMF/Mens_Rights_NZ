## What are men's rights?

Men's rights are the human rights issues that *uniquely* or *predominately* affect men and/or boys.

Men's unique human rights issues are ones that affect men *because they are men*. This can be because men are biologically different from women, which can lead to unique issues such as paternity fraud, or it can be because law and practice discriminate against men. 

There are also human rights issues that predominately affect men, for example, men are approximately 75% of suicide deaths, over 90% of prisoners, and have higher rates of preventable and treatable mortality.
