## What are men's rights?

Men's rights are the human rights issues that *uniquely* or *predominately* affect men and/or boys.

Men's unique human rights issues are ones that affect men *because they are men*. This can be because men are biologically different from women, which can lead to unique issues such as paternity fraud, or it can be because law and practice discriminate against men. 

There are also human rights issues that predominately affect men, for example, men are approximately 75% of suicide deaths, over 90% of prisoners, and have higher rates of preventable and treatable mortality.

## Government obligations
Human rights obligations are divided into three broad categories. Respect, protect, and fulfil. The obligation to **respect**, means that the government must not violate the rights of men and boys. The obligation to **protect**, means that the government must put laws and policies in place to prevent violations of human rights by non-government actors. For example, laws prohibiting domestic violence. The obligation to **fulfil**, means that the government must take positive steps to ensure that men and boys enjoy their rights in practice. This includes considering “factors that impede” men’s enjoyment of their rights and the removal of those obstacles.
