## The right to be free from discrimination

Men have the right to be free from discrimination.

Section 19(1) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights 1990 says "Everyone has the right to freedom from discrimination on the grounds of discrimination in the Human Rights Act 1993."

Article 7 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) (UDHR) states:

> All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.

The *[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights) (ICCPR)* and the *[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-economic-social-and-cultural-rights) (ICESCR)* prohibit discrimination in the application of each convention. New Zealand agreed to be legally bound by both conventions when it ratified them in 1978. 

Article 26 of the ICCPR also requires the government to make discrimination illegal and to protect men from discrimination.

> All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.

## Understanding Discrimination

The United Nations Human Rights Committee defines discrimination:

> [T]he Committee believes that the term “discrimination” as used in the Covenant should be understood to imply any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference which is based on... sex... which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing, of all rights and freedoms. [^1]


The United Nations Economic and Social Council adds some important points to discrimination under ICESCR.

> Non-discrimination is an immediate and cross-cutting obligation in the Covenant. Article 2, paragraph 2, requires States parties to guarantee non-discrimination in the exercise of each of the economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in the Covenant and can only be applied in conjunction with these rights. It is to be noted that discrimination constitutes any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference or other differential treatment that is directly or indirectly based on the prohibited grounds of discrimination and which has the intention or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of Covenant rights. Discrimination also includes incitement to discriminate and harassment.[^2]


There are five important points here, one, discrimination includes both act and omissions, two, discrimination can occur even if there is no intent to discriminate, and , three, discrimination includes unequal recognition of rights, four, discrimination against men must be addressed immediately, five, discrimination includes incitement to discriminate. 

### Acts and omissions
One, discrimination can be an *act* or an *omission*. For example, discrimination can occur when someone acts in a way that impairs men’s enjoyment of their rights, and it can occur when someone *fails to act* to protect men’s rights when such an act is required. For example, the Human Rights Committee says States are required to ensure men and women have equal rights in marriage, so failing to ensure men have equal rights with women is an omission that amounts to discrimination.

> ...States parties shall take appropriate steps to ensure equality of rights as well as responsibilities of spouses as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. Such steps may take the form of legislative, administrative or other measures, but **it is a positive duty of States parties to make certain that spouses have equal rights** as required by the Covenant.[^3] *Emphasis added*

### Intent and effect
Two, intent is not required for something to be discrimination. If an act, or omission, *has the effect* of impairing men’s rights, then that can be discrimination, even if there was no intent to impair men’s rights.

### Equal recognition of rights
Three, discrimination includes impairing the recognition of men’s rights on equal footing with women’s rights. Men and women have the same human rights, and treating men’s rights as less important (or more important) than women’s rights is discrimination. 

### Immediate obligation


### Incitement


## Formal and Substantive Discrimination

Formal discrimination is discrimination in laws and policy. 

Substantive discrimination occurs when prejudice or bias prevents the realisation of men’s rights, even when there is no formal discrimination. For example, gender-neutral partner violence laws may still disadvantage men because partner violence is broadly understood to be overwhelmingly female victims and male perpetrators. This can create a bias in police and social services which causes male victims to face additional barriers when seeking help and support. This impairs men's right to equal access to support services.
