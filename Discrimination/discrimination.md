## The right to be free from discrimination

Men have the right to be free from discrimination.

Section 19(1) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights 1990 says "Everyone has the right to freedom from discrimination on the grounds of discrimination in the Human Rights Act 1993."

Article 7 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) (UDHR) states:

> All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.

The *[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights) (ICCPR)* and the *[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-economic-social-and-cultural-rights) (ICESCR)* prohibit discrimination in the application of each convention. New Zealand agreed to be legally bound by both conventions when it ratified them in 1978. 

Article 26 of the ICCPR also requires the government to make discrimination illegal and to protect men from discrimination.

> All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
