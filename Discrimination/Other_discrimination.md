## Discrimination in the Justice system

Men are over-represented in prison compared to women. In June 2025, 92.4% of prisoners were male and 7.6% were female.

Women who enter the justice system are filtered out at every natural attrition point more than men. Men are more likely to be prosecuted rather than given an alternative like being warned or discharged without conviction. Men are more likely to be sent to prison once convicted. Men receive longer sentences on average and are less likely to be released on parole.[^1]

Jeffries found discrimination against men in several areas of the justice system:

> In all but one case (the initial decision to imprison) sex was found to have a direct impact on the judicial outcomes investigated including: length of imprisonment term, remand status, length of custodial remand and bail conditions. With other factors statistically controlled, women’s imprisonment terms were found to be substantially shorter than men’s..[^2]

29. Patterson found similar discrimination against men for sexual assault cases.

> In terms of police decision-making processes, compared to males, a smaller proportion of females proceeded to “court action” for their offences. Furthermore, the severity of sentences handed down to males was greater than those handed down to females, both generally and when the sexual offence could be directly matched.[^3]

Discrimination against men in the justice system is a long-term systemic problem. For example, Bindler[^4] found a persistent sentencing gap disadvantaging men when reviewing 200 years of cases from the Old Bailey, London. 

Although men face significant discrimination and are significantly over-represented in the justice system, the Department of Corrections “has made efforts to limit the number of women coming to prison, and data shows that these efforts have been successful”[^6] 

This bias against men is consistent with international research.[^7]
