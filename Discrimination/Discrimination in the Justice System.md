title: Discrimination in the Justice System
description: New Zealand's justice system violates men's right right to a fair trial and to not to be arbitrarily detained.
---


Men have the right to a fair trial, unfortunately there is discrimination against men in the justice system.

New Zealand is required to treat men and women equally in the justice system. Men must be free from arbitrary detention.

Section 22 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act states: "Everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily arrested or detained."

Article 9.1 

>Arrest or detention on discriminatory grounds in violation of article 2, paragraph 1, article 3 or article 26 is also in principle arbitrary'.[^1] 


## Police use of force

Men have the right to be protected from excessive force from the Police, however, Police are more likely to use force against men when it is not required. The Human Rights Committee states:

 >The right to security of person protects individuals against intentional infliction of bodily or mental injury, regardless of whether the victim is detained or non-detained... \[States] should also prevent and redress unjustifiable use of force in law enforcement,  and protect their populations against abuses by private security forces, and against the risks posed by excessive availability of firearms. [^2]

Police discriminate against men when considering whether to use force. A review of Police TASER use found that officers are more likely to use force against men than women:

> Women are significantly less likely to be TASERed despite demonstrating more assaultive behaviour in TASER video footage. Men were more likely to be TASERed for what appeared to be compliance, or for ‘passive resistant behaviour’. Video observations indicate far less assaultive behaviour than women. Officers consider the gender of the individual, particularly before discharging a TASER.[^3]

> It was observed that the level of threat and physical assault was very high in the videos where females are TASERed. There was no evidence of the TASER being used to gain compliance or control over a situation, generally the level of threat to officers included either possession of a weapon and/or a physical assault. **Analysis of TASER discharge events involving men indicated that the threshold for threat is considerably lower. In some cases, men were TASERed for non-compliance, or to gain control over a situation when no physical threat or weapon was present** (noted in the report or apparent in the video). Women were also more likely to be taken for treatment in a mental health crisis and less likely to be charged than men.[^4] 
> *Emphasis added*

Police policy forbids use of TASER for compliance:
> Caution: Under no circumstances must the device be applied (i.e. contact stun and/or discharge) to an uncooperative but otherwise non-aggressive person to
induce compliance.[^5]

*\*There is no total percentage for TOR Events due to, in some instances, there being more than one person involved in a single event.*

Additionally, men were more likely to be TASERed in sensitive areas.

> Generally, females were TASERed in the upper body (chest/abdomen), the lowest point of the 
body indicated was lower back (two cases). There were examples of men being TASERed in 
the groin, face, buttocks, and legs.

> Caution: The head, face, neck, chest and groin area should not be deliberately targeted unless the
appropriate level of force can be justified. See target areas in blue in diagram below.[^6]

## Prosecutions
Brown[^7] studied Police administrative data to investigate factors that may influence the likelihood of prosecution. He includes data from official statistics and previous studies.

Brown reports that official statistics show "Males made up over 76% of proceedings and were prosecuted at a higher rate than females, 72.5% vs 65% respectively."

Brown reports the results of  two internal Police studies from 2018 and 2020.

> On average, males were 12\% more likely to be prosecuted than females for the same offence. For the particular crimes measured, Police were far more likely to prosecute males over females. The 2018 report stated that for ‘Threatening Behaviour’, Police were 64\% more likely to prosecute males. The 2020 report found that, for ‘Resist or Hinder Officer or Justice Official’, males were 45\% more likely to be prosecuted. Both studies found that sex was not a significant factor in other crime types such as ‘Possess Illicit Drugs’, and ‘Theft from Retail Premises’.

> The studies found evidence that sex and ethnicity affect the prosecution decision for certain crime types (even after controlling for other factors, such as criminal history). While not apparent for all offence types measured, they found that the odds of prosecution for males, on average, are significantly greater than females for some offence types (Assault, Disorderly Conduct)

Brown's research did not find a significant difference between males and females in the decision to prosecute overall. However, "There is some variability when looking at specific offences. Males are significantly more likely to be prosecuted for ‘Dangerous Driving’ (90%), are over twice as likely to be prosecuted for ‘Threatening Behaviour’ (110%), and ‘Property Damage’ (51%). Females are significantly more likely to be prosecuted for ‘Possessing Illicit Drugs’ (32%) and ‘Trespassing’ (29%)."

## Sentencing and prison

Men are over-represented in prison compared to women. In June 2025, 92.4% of prisoners were male and 7.6% were female.[^8]

Women who enter the justice system are filtered out at every natural attrition point more than men. Men are more likely to be prosecuted rather than given an alternative like being warned or discharged without conviction. Men are more likely to be sent to prison once convicted. Men receive longer sentences on average and are less likely to be released on parole.[^9] This bias against men is consistent with international research.[^10]

Jeffries found discrimination against men in several areas of the justice system:

> In all but one case (the initial decision to imprison) sex was found to have a direct impact on the judicial outcomes investigated including: length of imprisonment term, remand status, length of custodial remand and bail conditions. With other factors statistically controlled, women’s imprisonment terms were found to be substantially shorter than men’s.[^11]

Patterson found similar discrimination against men for sexual assault cases.

> In terms of police decision-making processes, compared to males, a smaller proportion of females proceeded to “court action” for their offences. Furthermore, the severity of sentences handed down to males was greater than those handed down to females, both generally and when the sexual offence could be directly matched.[^12]

Discrimination against men in the justice system is a long-term systemic problem. For example, Bindler[^13] found a persistent sentencing gap disadvantaging men when reviewing 200 years of cases from the Old Bailey, London. 

Although men face significant discrimination and are significantly over-represented in the justice system, the Department of Corrections “has made efforts to limit the number of women coming to prison, and data shows that these efforts have been successful”[^14] 

## Sentencing Guidelines for sexual offences

Men who are victims of sexual assault by a woman do not receive the same level of justice as women assaulted by men.

New Zealand’s rape and sexual assault law and subsequent sentencing guidelines treat women who have non-consensual sex with men more leniently than men who have non-consensual with women. Sentencing guidelines released by the Court of Appeal make a clear distinction between rape by penetration and other forms of sexual assault.[^15] This creates a significant difference between men and women. For example, a man having sex with a women without her consent, with no aggravating factors, is recommended a 6-8 years sentence, in the reverse situation the women is recommended a 2-5 year sentence.
