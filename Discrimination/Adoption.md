# Adoption
The Human Rights Commission identified Section 4(2) of the Adoption Act 1955 as discriminatory against men.[^1]
The law states: "An adoption order shall not be made in respect of a child who is a female in favour of a sole applicant who is a male unless the court is satisfied that the applicant is the father of the child or that there are special circumstances which justify the making of an adoption order."
