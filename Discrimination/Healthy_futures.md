# Healthy Futures Act
One of the objectives of the Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Act 2022 is to "achieve equity in health outcomes among New Zealand's population groups, including by striving to eliminate health disparities".[^4] However, the Act requires the Ministry of Health to create a women's health strategy, but not a men's health strategy. Mongolia, Australia, Ireland, Iran, Malaysia, South Africa, Brazil, and the state of Quebec all have men's health strategies.

 Jehan Casinader reports "When I asked the Ministry of Health to tell me about its initiatives focused specifically on men, I heard  \[nothing\]. Although it has a women's health strategy, New Zealand does not have a men's health strategy, and the ministry has no plans to develop one."[^1]
