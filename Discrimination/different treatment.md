Different treatment between men and women is not always discrimination. Under international human rights law sometimes different treatment is justified or even required.[^1] New Zealand is required to ensure equal enjoyment of rights between men and women and to ensure men and women do not face discrimination. To meet these obligations New Zealand has to address any unequal enjoyment of rights or discrimination. Sometimes this means treating men and women differently to address the disadvantages faced by men or women. 

Removing formal discrimination does not mean the effect of the discrimination is removed. For example, if a group was not allowed to vote and the law was changed to allow them to vote, it may be necessary to have special programs to enroll members of this group and help them learn about voting. Just changing the law does not mean that the group will fully enjoy their right to vote on equal terms with experienced voters. 

The Human Rights Committee says different treatment in order to correct for discrimination is legitimate under ICCPR:

> The Committee also wishes to point out that **the principle of equality sometimes requires States parties to take affirmative action in order to diminish or eliminate conditions which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination** prohibited by the Covenant. For example, in a State where the general conditions of a certain part of the population prevent or impair their enjoyment of human rights, the State should take specific action to correct those conditions. Such action may involve granting for a time to the part of the population concerned certain preferential treatment in specific matters as compared with the rest of the population. However, as long as such action is needed to correct discrimination in fact, it is a case of legitimate differentiation under the Covenant.[^2] 

Similarly the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights says:

> States parties are encouraged to adopt temporary special measures to **accelerate the achievement of equality between men and women** in the enjoyment of the rights under the Covenant.  Such measures are not to be considered discriminatory in themselves as they are grounded in the State’s **obligation to eliminate disadvantage caused by past and current discriminatory laws, traditions and practices**.  The nature, duration and application of such measures should be designed with reference to the **specific issue** and **context**, and should be **adjusted as circumstances require**.  The results of such measures should be monitored with a view to being **discontinued** when the objectives for which they are undertaken have been achieved.[^3] 

States must take into account "apparently gender-neutral laws, policies and programmes" to consider if they negatively affect men and boys.

> ...In particular, it is incumbent upon States parties to take into account the effect of apparently gender-neutral laws, policies and programmes and to consider whether they could result in a negative impact on the ability of men and women to enjoy their human rights on a basis of equality.[^4] 

> To design and implement policies and programmes to give long-term effect to the economic, social and cultural rights of both men and women on the basis of equality.  These may include the adoption of **temporary special measures** to accelerate women’s equal enjoyment of their rights, gender audits, and **gender-specific allocation of resources;**[^5]

There are issues relevant to men's rights here:

First, the consideration and application of 'affirmative action' must itself be free from bias and discrimination. Men should receive the same kind of affirmative action to address discrimination and unequal enjoyment of their rights as women.

Second, not all preferential treatment for women is discrimination under international human rights law. However, different treatment must be justified.

Third, improper application of 'affirmative action' for women *is* discrimination against men.


## When different treatment is justified
Sometimes, to protect and ensure human rights, different treatment is justified. For example, 

> In order to fulfil the obligation set forth in article 3, States parties **should take account of the factors which impede** the equal enjoyment by women and men of each right specified in the Covenant.[^35] 

## Requirements for different treatment
International human rights law has specific requirements for different treatment. 

> Finally, the Committee observes that not every differentiation of treatment will constitute discrimination, if the criteria for such differentiation are **reasonable and objective** and if the aim is to achieve a purpose which is legitimate under the Covenant.[^36] 

> Differential treatment based on prohibited grounds will be viewed as discriminatory unless the justification for differentiation is **reasonable and objective**. This will include an assessment as to whether the aim and effects of the measures or omissions are **legitimate, compatible with the nature of the Covenant rights** and solely for the purpose of promoting the **general welfare in a democratic society**. In addition, there must be a clear and reasonable relationship of **proportionality** between the aim sought to be realized and the measures or omissions and their effects. A failure to remove differential treatment on the basis of a lack of available resources is not an objective and reasonable justification unless every effort has been made to use all resources that are at the State party’s disposition in an effort to address and eliminate the discrimination, as a matter of priority.[^37] 

> Eliminating systemic discrimination will frequently require devoting greater resources to traditionally neglected groups.[^38] 

### Reasonable
Any special measures must be reasonable, that is "based on or using good judgment and therefore fair and practical"[^51] "Governed by or being in accordance with reason or sound thinking"[^52] "Just; fair; agreeable to reason."[^53]

To be reasonable, the problem and potential solutions must be clearly understood, the available alternatives must be considered, and the final choice between alternatives must be logical.

The path to improving the situation must be clearly laid out in advance. EG
- X is a problem 
- Y is known to reduce the problem
- therefore we should do Y to address X

Not:
- X is a problem, if we spend more money on Y it will magically help.

Reasonable means identifying unstated assumptions.  For example, assuming that men in power means men's needs are considered in decisions. Or that "gender is a hierarchy that privileges men and disadvantages women" 

If there are unstated assumptions, then the logic of the decision may be flawed.

Reasonable means assessing likely situations where the special measure could backfire, or harm another group.

Reasonable means identifying the human rights issue that is being addressed. Special measures are only legitimate if they support the human rights of the target group, and do not impair the rights of others. 

Reasonable means being sure that special measures are required. Or when preferential or specific treatment is required.

 The special measures must be fit for the need. They should be expected to address the specific issue at hand. 

### Objective
Objective means "Based on observed facts; without purely subjective assessment."[^54] "expressing or dealing with facts or conditions as perceived without distortion by personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations"[^55]

Objective means assessing available evidence for the causes and solutions to the problem. 

Objective means discarding ideological opinions.

A problem must be clearly identified, and be able to be measured. Measurements must measure what they say they are measuring. Proxy measurements should be used only if direct measurements are not possible.

##### Consider this hypothetical issue:
Women's needs are not represented in decision making. 
We can measure the number of decision makers who are women, but this does not necessarily relate to decision makers addressing women needs. It is possible that men are attentive to women's needs or women are not. Therefore, the using the number of women who are decision makers is not a direct measure of whether women's needs are taken into consideration.

#### Monitoring is required
Objectivity requires monitoring and evaluation. Data must be collected about the program or policy to establish if it is meeting it's goals or having unintended effects.

> Elimination of de jure as well as de facto  discrimination is required for the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.  **Failure to adopt, implement and monitor effects of laws, policies and programmes** to eliminate de jure  and de facto discrimination with respect to each of the rights enumerated in articles 6 to 15 of the Covenant **constitutes a violation of those rights.**[^39] 

> States parties **should regularly assess** whether the measures chosen are **effective in practice**.[^40] 

### Necessary
Different treatment must be necessary to reach the intended goals. 

- "Required, essential, whether logically inescapable or needed in order to achieve a desired result or avoid some penalty."[^56]
- "needed in order to achieve a particular result"[^57]

If a program or policy can meet the goals of protecting or supporting a groups human rights by universal means, then different treatment is not necessary.

### Proportional
The special measure must be proportional to the disadvantage that is being addressed. 

- "in correct relation to: *The degree of punishment is meant to be proportional to the seriousness of the crime.*[^58]
- "having due proportion; corresponding"[^59]
- " Properly related in size, degree, or other measurable characteristics; corresponding: *Punishment ought to be proportional to the crime.*"[^60]
- "In the correct or balanced relation or proportion: *Salary raises were proportional to the cost of living*."

Proportionality means, when similarly effective options are available, choosing the alternative that has the lest impact on others.  

> In addition, **there must be a clear and reasonable relationship of proportionality between the aim sought to be realized and the measures or omissions and their effects**. A failure to remove differential treatment on the basis of a lack of available resources is not an objective and reasonable justification unless every effort has been made to use all resources that are at the State party’s disposition in an effort to address and eliminate the discrimination, as a matter of priority.[^62] 


> However, the application of the principle of equality will sometimes require that States parties take measures in favour of women in order to attenuate or suppress conditions that perpetuate discrimination.  As long as these measures are necessary to redress de facto discrimination and are terminated when de facto equality is achieved,  such differentiation is legitimate. [^63] However, there is one exception to this general principle [ie measures in favour of women in order to attenuate or suppress conditions that perpetuate discrimination]:  reasons specific to an individual male candidate may tilt the balance in his favour, which is to be assessed **objectively**, taking into account all criteria pertaining to the individual candidates.  This is a requirement of the principle of **proportionality**.[^41]

### Time limited
Special measures should be time limited and end once the goal is reached. The goal should be stated on commencement, and not be changed during the period without the same requirements (reasonable, objective etc.) to justify the change.

Some measures can be permanent, but these must be clearly identified.
Permanent measures are to address inherent disadvantages, such as disadvantages due to biology like men's paternity uncertainty, or women's ability to bear children. Pregnant women, for example, may receive extra help and support.

### Promoting general welfare and supporting human rights
Special measures must support the protection and promotion of human rights.

Special measures that undermine 'general welfare of society' should be avoided. Note: Affirmative action for men is disliked more than for women, so **care must be taken not to cause disharmony and resentment**. 

> Differential treatment based on prohibited grounds will be viewed as discriminatory unless the justification for differentiation is reasonable and objective. This will include an assessment as to whether the aim and effects of the measures or omissions are legitimate, compatible with the nature of the Covenant rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the **general welfare in a democratic society**.[^62] 


## CEDAW Standards

CEDAW General Recommendation 25 explains the standards for applying special measures to address discrimination against women and ensure substantive equality between women and men. These standards should be used for special measures to address discrimination against men and ensure substantive equality for men. After all, if the goal is substantive equality between women and men, then men's inequalities must be addressed.

### Standards

#### 1. Substantive equality
> The enjoyment of human rights on the basis of equality between men and women must be understood comprehensively.  **Guarantees of non-discrimination and equality in international human rights treaties mandate both de facto and de jure equality.**  De jure (or formal) equality and **de facto (or substantive)** equality are different but interconnected concepts.  Formal equality assumes that equality is achieved if a law or policy treats men and women in a neutral manner.  Substantive equality is concerned, in addition, with the effects of laws, policies and practices and with ensuring that **they do not maintain, but rather alleviate, the inherent disadvantage that particular groups experience**.[^6]


> Substantive equality for men and women will not be achieved simply through the enactment of laws or the adoption of policies that are, prima facie, gender-neutral.  In implementing article 3, States parties should take into account that such laws, policies and practice can fail to address or even perpetuate inequality between men and women because they do not take account of existing economic, social and cultural inequalities, particularly those experienced by women.[^7]  

> Failure to ensure formal and substantive equality in the enjoyment of any of these rights constitutes a violation of that right.  Elimination of de jure as well as de facto  discrimination is required for the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.[^8]


> **Equality of results is the logical corollary of de facto or substantive equality**. These results may be quantitative and/or qualitative in nature; that is, women enjoying their rights in various fields in fairly equal numbers with men, enjoying the same income levels, equality in decision-making and political influence, and women enjoying freedom from violence. [^50]

#### 2. "irrespective of any proof of past discrimination"

> While the application of temporary special measures often remedies the effects of past discrimination against women, the obligation of States parties under the Convention to improve the position of women to one of de facto or substantive equality with men exists **irrespective of any proof of past discrimination**. The Committee considers that States parties that adopt and implement such measures under the Convention do not discriminate against men.[^49]


#### 3. Monitoring 

Affirmative actions must be monitored so that:
1. they can be ended when no longer necessary
2. Prevent adverse affects.

> To develop **monitoring mechanisms** to ensure that the implementation of laws and policies aimed at promoting the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by men and women do not have unintended adverse effects on disadvantaged or marginalized individuals or groups, particularly women and girls;[^9]

> The results of such measures should be **monitored** with a view to being discontinued when the objectives for which they are undertaken have been achieved.[^10]


> Failure to adopt, implement and **monitor effects** of laws, policies and programmes to eliminate de jure  and de facto discrimination with respect to each of the rights enumerated in articles 6 to 15 of the Covenant constitutes a violation of those rights.[^11]

> Thus, continuous monitoring of laws, programmes and practices directed at the achievement of women’s de facto or substantive equality is needed so as to avoid a perpetuation of non-identical treatment that may no longer be warranted.[^21] 

#### 4. Do no harm

> To develop monitoring mechanisms to ensure that the implementation of laws and policies aimed at promoting the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by men and women **do not have unintended adverse effects on disadvantaged or marginalized individuals or groups**, particularly women and girls[^12]

>  The adoption and undertaking of any **retrogressive measures** that affect the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of the all the rights set forth in the Covenant constitutes a violation of article 3[^13]

#### 5. Identify specific issues for men and women

>32. These strategies should be based on the **systematic identification of policies, programmes and activities relevant to the situation and context within the State, as derived from the normative content of article 3** of the Covenant and spelled out in relation to the levels and nature of States parties’ obligations referred to in paragraphs 16 to 21 above.  The strategies should give particular attention to the elimination of discrimination in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.[^14]

> The nature, duration and application of such measures should be designed with reference to the **specific issue** and **context**, and should be **adjusted as circumstances require**.  The results of such measures should be monitored with a view to being **discontinued** when the objectives for which they are undertaken have been achieved.[^15]

#### 6. Temporary special measures must be identified and distinguished from permanent measures

> ...Temporary special measures should be distinguished from permanent policies and strategies undertaken to achieve equality of men and women.[^16]

> **Women’s biologically determined permanent needs and experiences should be distinguished from other needs that may be the result of past and present discrimination** against women by individual actors, the **dominant gender ideology**, or by **manifestations of such discrimination in social and cultural structures and institutions**. As steps are being taken to eliminate discrimination against women, women’s needs may change or disappear, or become the needs of both women and men. Thus, continuous monitoring of laws, programmes and practices directed at the achievement of women’s de facto or substantive equality is needed so as to avoid a perpetuation of non-identical treatment that may no longer be warranted.[^21] 


### Reasons that CEDAW standards for affirmative action should be applied to men

#### De jure equality
While CEDAW concerns itself with addressing discrimination against women the goal of CEDAW is de facto and de jure equality with men. De facto and de jure equality can only be achieved by addressing inequalities that are faced by men and boys.

> The scope and meaning of article 4, paragraph 1, must be determined in the context of **the overall object and purpose of the Convention, which is to** eliminate all forms of discrimination against women with a view to **achieving women’s de jure and de facto equality with men in the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms**. States parties to the Convention are under a legal obligation to respect, protect, promote and fulfil this right to non-discrimination for women and to ensure the development and advancement of women in order to improve their position to one of **de jure as well as de facto equality with men**.[^17] 

#### CEDAW prohibits the maintenance of different standards
CEDAW prohibits the maintenance of separate standards for women and men. 

#### Lack of jurisprudence on addressing men's discrimination
There is little jurisprudence or guidance for governments to address discrimination against men. In the absence of guidance to the contrary, the principles of equality and non-discrimination suggest that the standards used for women should be used for men.

#### States are required to equally protect the human rights of men and boys
ICCPR and ICESCR require states to ensure equal enjoyment of rights between men and women. ICCPR prohibits discrimination against men.

> The Convention goes beyond the concept of discrimination used in many national and **international legal standards and norms. While such standards and norms prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sex and *protect both men and women* from treatment based on arbitrary, unfair and/or unjustifiable distinctions**, the Convention focuses on discrimination against women, emphasizing that women have suffered, and continue to suffer from various forms of discrimination because they are women.[^18] 

#### CEDAW does not limit states to things that are more conducive to equality

> CEDAW Article 23

> Nothing in the present Convention shall affect any provisions that are **more conducive to the achievement of equality between men and women** which may be contained: 
> 
> (a) In the legislation of a State Party; or
> 
> (b) In any other international convention, treaty or agreement in force for that State.

#### Addressing stereotypes
States are required to address stereotypes.  Policies that treat women and men differently can reinforce stereotypes. 

See: ICESCR General Comment 16, paragraph 19 and CEDAW

### Considering specific circumstances

Special measures should consider the specific circumstances of women and men. This could be used to argue that the standards applied for special measures for women should not be used for men. However, this does not stand up:

- In any case, the standard of specific circumstances should be applied to both women and men. 
- Some different standards related to specific circumstances may need to be considered, but 
	- 1) that does not mean **all** standards related to affirmative action should be different, 
	- 2) that only women should benefit from different standards in specific circumstances. Men should benefit from different standards where it is applicable. 
	- 3) The different standards for affirmative action in specific circumstances should be limited to the specific circumstances. there is no excuse for wide-ranging use of different standards.

Care should be taken that the consideration of specific circumstances is not gender biased or based on stereotypical assumptions about the situation for men and women. EG that women are disadvantaged and men are privileged.

> The nature, duration and application of such measures should be designed with reference to the **specific issue** and **context**, and should be **adjusted as circumstances require**.  The results of such measures should be monitored with a view to being **discontinued** when the objectives for which they are undertaken have been achieved.[^19]

> The position of women will not be improved as long as the underlying causes of discrimination against women, and of their inequality, are not effectively addressed. **The lives of women and men must be considered in a contextual way**, and measures adopted towards a real transformation of opportunities, institutions and systems so that they are no longer grounded in historically determined male paradigms of power and life patterns.[^20]

States should consider men's biological needs, past or present discrimination, dominant gender ideology, and manifestations of discrimination against men is cultural and social structures and institutions.

> **Women’s biologically determined permanent needs and experiences should be distinguished from other needs that may be the result of past and present discrimination** against women by individual actors, the **dominant gender ideology**, or by **manifestations of such discrimination in social and cultural structures and institutions**. As steps are being taken to eliminate discrimination against women, women’s needs may change or disappear, or become the needs of both women and men. Thus, continuous monitoring of laws, programmes and practices directed at the achievement of women’s de facto or substantive equality is needed so as to avoid a perpetuation of non-identical treatment that may no longer be warranted.[^21] 

States should recognise that some culture and social institutions are based on women's experiences or needs are not suitable for men and boys. EG seeing men as defective women by using a deficit model of masculinity.

The causes and consequences of discrimination against men differ from those of women, but nevertheless should be addressed. 

> The Convention, targets discriminatory dimensions of past and current societal and cultural contexts which impede women’s enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms. It aims at the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, **including the elimination of the causes and consequences of their de facto or substantive inequality**. Therefore, the application of temporary special measures in accordance with the Convention is one of the means to realize de facto or substantive equality for women, rather than an exception to the norms of non-discrimination and equality.[^22]


ICCPR (etc.) requires States to "take the necessary steps" to ensure men enjoy their rights and address "factors that impede" the men's enjoyment or rights.[^23]

> 8.	Substantive equality for men and women will not be achieved simply through the enactment of laws or the adoption of policies that are, prima facie, gender-neutral.  In implementing article 3, States parties should take into account that such laws, policies and practice can fail to address or even perpetuate inequality between men and women because they **do not take account of existing economic, social and cultural inequalities**, particularly those experienced by women.[^24] 


## Not all preferential treatment is discrimination
Second, not all preferential treatment for women is discrimination.

## Improper application of affirmative action is discrimination
Third, improper application of 'affirmative action' for women *is* discrimination against men.



> **Substantive discrimination**: *Merely addressing formal discrimination will not ensure substantive equality as envisaged and defined by article 2, paragraph 2*. The effective enjoyment of Covenant rights is often influenced by whether a person is a member of a group characterized by the prohibited grounds of discrimination. Eliminating discrimination in practice requires paying sufficient attention to groups of individuals which suffer historical or persistent prejudice instead of merely comparing the formal treatment of individuals in similar situations. States parties must therefore immediately adopt the necessary measures to prevent, diminish and eliminate the conditions and attitudes which cause or perpetuate substantive or de facto  discrimination. For example, ensuring that all individuals have equal access to adequate housing, water and sanitation will help to overcome discrimination against women and girl children and persons living in informal settlements and rural areas.[^25] 

>  **In order to eliminate substantive discrimination, States parties may be, and in some cases are, under an obligation to adopt special measures to attenuate or suppress conditions that perpetuate discrimination.** Such measures are legitimate to the extent that they represent **reasonable, objective and proportional** means to **redress de facto discrimination** and are **discontinued** when substantive  equality has been **sustainably achieved**. Such **positive measures may exceptionally, however, need to be of a permanent nature**, such as interpretation services for linguistic minorities and reasonable accommodation of persons with sensory impairments in accessing health-care facilities.[^26] 

> The enjoyment of human rights on the basis of equality between men and women must be understood comprehensively.  Guarantees of non-discrimination and equality in international human rights treaties mandate both de facto  and de jure equality.  De jure (or formal) equality and de facto (or substantive) equality are different but interconnected concepts.  Formal equality assumes that equality is achieved if a law or policy treats men and women in a neutral manner.  Substantive equality is concerned, in addition, with the effects of laws, policies and practices and with ensuring that they do not maintain, but rather alleviate, the inherent disadvantage that particular groups experience.[^27] 

> Substantive equality for men and women will not be achieved simply through the enactment of laws or the adoption of policies that are, prima facie, **gender-neutral**.  In implementing article 3, States parties should take into account that such laws, policies and practice can fail to address or even perpetuate inequality between men and women because they do not take account of existing economic, social and cultural inequalities, particularly those  experienced by women.[^28] 

> Indirect discrimination occurs when a law, policy or programme does not appear to be discriminatory, but has a discriminatory effect when implemented.  This can occur, for example, when women are disadvantaged compared to men with respect to the enjoyment of a particular opportunity or benefit due to pre-existing inequalities.  **Applying a gender-neutral law may leave the existing inequality in place, or exacerbate it**.[^29] 

### Limited resources are not an excuse for differential treatment.

Limited resources are not an excuse for differential treatment unless all resources at a States disposal have been used.

For example, if the decision to use all women shortlists is based on the fact that other methods to increase women's representation are too resource intensive, that is not a valid excuse for preferential treatment of women, unless every effort has been made to use the resources available. 
For example, resources could be dedicated to supporting new or female candidates rather than excluding men from the shortlist. 


## Temporary special measures

> shall in no way entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate standards CEDAW article 4.1

Thus, the standards applied to addressing discrimination against women, must be applied to addressing discrimination against men.


> ...States parties are encouraged, among other possible steps, to adopt temporary special measures in order to accelerate the achievement of equality... [^30]

> The principles of equality and non-discrimination, by themselves, are not always sufficient to guarantee true equality.  Temporary special measures may sometimes be needed in order to bring disadvantaged or marginalized persons or groups of persons to the same substantive level as others.  Temporary special measures aim at realizing not only de jure or formal equality, but also de facto or substantive equality for men and women.  However, the application of the principle of equality will sometimes require that States parties take measures in favour of women in order to attenuate or suppress conditions that perpetuate discrimination.  As long as these measures are necessary to redress de facto discrimination and are terminated when de facto equality is achieved,  such differentiation is legitimate.[^31] 

> To design and implement policies and programmes to give long-term effect to the economic, social and cultural rights of both men and women on the basis of equality.  These may include the adoption of temporary special measures to accelerate women’s equal enjoyment of their rights, gender audits, and gender-specific allocation of resources;[^32] 

> The adoption of temporary special measures may be necessary to accelerate the equal enjoyment by women of all economic, social and cultural rights and to improve the de facto position of women.  Temporary special measures should be distinguished from permanent policies and strategies undertaken to achieve equality of men and women.[^33] 


> States parties are encouraged to adopt temporary special measures to accelerate the achievement of equality between men and women in the enjoyment of the rights under the Covenant.  Such measures are not to be considered discriminatory in themselves as they are grounded in the State’s obligation to eliminate disadvantage caused by past and current discriminatory laws, traditions and practices.  The nature, duration and application of such measures should be designed with reference to the specific issue and context, and should be adjusted as circumstances require.  The results of such measures should be monitored with a view to being discontinued when the objectives for which they are undertaken have been achieved.[^34] 






## Required
>  The Committee wishes to draw the attention of States parties to the fact that the Covenant **sometimes expressly requires them to take measures to guarantee the equality of rights of the persons concerned**. For example, article 23, paragraph 4, stipulates that States parties shall take appropriate steps to ensure equality of rights as well as responsibilities of spouses as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. Such steps may take the form of legislative, administrative or other measures, but it is a positive duty of States parties to make certain that spouses have equal rights as required by the Covenant.[^42] 

## Not justified
> In becoming parties to the Covenant, States undertake, in accordance with article 3, to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil and political rights set forth in the Covenant, and in accordance with article 5, **nothing in the Covenant may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights provided for in article 3**, or at limitations not covered by the Covenant.[^43] 

> Violations of the rights contained in the Covenant can occur through the direct action of, failure to act or omission by States parties, or through their institutions or agencies at the national and local levels.  **The adoption and undertaking of any retrogressive measures that affect the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of the all the rights set forth in the Covenant constitutes a violation of article 3**.[^44]  

Note: Forcing equal outcomes for women could violate their right to autonomy (ie to make their own decisions)

### Lack of resources not a valid excuse for different treatment

## Discrimination in the application of affirmative action.
Men have the same right to affirmative action as women. If affirmative action is not apply to men in a situation where it would be applied to women then that is discrimination.




## CEDAW

not maintain separate standards

> **Article 4**

> 1. Adoption by States Parties of temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between men and women shall not be considered discrimination as defined in the present Convention, **but shall in no way entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate standards; these measures shall be discontinued when the objectives of equality of opportunity and treatment have been achieved**.

> 2. Adoption by States Parties of special measures, including those measures contained in the present Convention, aimed at protecting maternity shall not be considered discriminatory.


> Measures taken under article 4, paragraph 1, by States parties should aim to accelerate the equal participation of women in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field. The Committee views the application of these measures not as an exception to the norm of non-discrimination, but rather as an emphasis that temporary special measures are part of a necessary strategy by States parties directed towards the achievement of de facto or substantive equality of women with men in the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms. While the application of temporary special measures often remedies the effects of past discrimination against women, the obligation of States parties under the Convention to improve the position of women to one of de facto or substantive equality with men exists *irrespective of any proof of past discrimination*. **The Committee considers that States parties that adopt and implement such measures under the Convention do not discriminate against men**. [^45]




## Involvement in decisions regarding affirmative action

Men and men's advocates should be involved in decision making regrading any sex-based preferential treatment, for women or men.

Men may be affected by preferential treatment for women, and have a right to have their concerns heard.

> In addition to refraining from discriminatory actions, States parties should take concrete, deliberate and targeted measures to ensure that discrimination in the exercise of Covenant rights is eliminated. Individuals and groups of individuals, who may be distinguished by one or more of the prohibited grounds, **should be ensured the right to participate in decision-making processes over the selection of such measures**. States parties **should regularly assess** whether the measures chosen are **effective in practice**.[^46] 

>  To promote equal participation of men and women in development planning, decision-making and in the benefits of development and all programmes related to the realization of economic, social and cultural rights[^47]  


> The right of individuals and groups of individuals to **participate in decision-making processes that may affect their development** must be an integral component of any policy, programme or activity developed to discharge governmental obligations under article 3 of the Covenant.[^48] 

## Prevent further imbalances from arising
CERD general recommendation No. 32, paragraph 22, states that special measures can be for preventing further imbalances from arising.

Therefore, special measures includes measures to prevent imbalances that disadvantage men from arising. EG special measures to support women in university has ended, but a trend that shows men are increasingly disadvantaged merits special measures to prevent an imbalance.


# Preferential  vs specific treatment
Different treatment can be *preferential* treatment or *specific* treatment. 
Preferential treatment means allocating resources to a disadvantaged group to alleviate the disadvantage

Specific treatment means different treatment that is based on needs. For example, men may need male specific programs, or policies, that are complimented by women only programs or polices.

Preferential treatment for women, should not be used when specific treatment is more appropriate. For example, women's shelters without similar support for men is preferential treatment, while providing both women and men support based on their unique needs is specific treatment.


# Wicked problems

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem

> In planning and policy, a wicked problem is a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize. It refers to an idea or problem that cannot be fixed, where there is no single solution to the problem; "wicked" does not indicate evil, but rather resistance to resolution. Another definition is "a problem whose social complexity means that it has no determinable stopping point". Because of complex interdependencies, the effort to solve one aspect of a wicked problem may reveal or create other problems. Due to their complexity, wicked problems are often characterized by organized irresponsibility.
