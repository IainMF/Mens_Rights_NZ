title: Different Treatment
description: Different treatment is sometimes justified or required.
---

Different treatment between men and women is not always discrimination. Under international human rights law sometimes different treatment is justified or even required.

>  The enjoyment of rights and freedoms on an equal footing, however, does not mean identical treatment in every instance. CCPR General Comment 18, paragraph 8

> The Committee also wishes to point out that t**he principle of equality sometimes requires States parties to take affirmative action in order to diminish or eliminate conditions which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination** prohibited by the Covenant. For example, in a State where the general conditions of a certain part of the population prevent or impair their enjoyment of human rights, the State should take specific action to correct those conditions. Such action may involve granting for a time to the part of the population concerned certain preferential treatment in specific matters as compared with the rest of the population. However, as long as such action is needed to correct discrimination in fact, it is a case of legitimate differentiation under the Covenant. CCPR General Comment 18, paragraph 10

> **Substantive discrimination**: *Merely addressing formal discrimination will not ensure substantive equality as envisaged and defined by article 2, paragraph 2*. The effective <![endif]--> enjoyment of Covenant rights is often influenced by whether a person is a member of a group characterized by the prohibited grounds of discrimination. Eliminating discrimination in practice requires paying sufficient attention to groups of individuals which suffer historical or persistent prejudice instead of merely comparing the formal treatment of individuals in similar situations. States parties must therefore immediately adopt the necessary measures to prevent, diminish and eliminate the conditions and attitudes which cause or perpetuate substantive or de facto  discrimination. For example, ensuring that all individuals have equal access to adequate housing, water and sanitation will help to overcome discrimination against women and girl children and persons living in informal settlements and rural areas. ICESCR General Comment 20, paragraph 8

>  **In order to eliminate substantive discrimination, States parties may be, and in some cases are, under an obligation to adopt special measures to attenuate or suppress conditions that perpetuate discrimination.** Such measures are legitimate to the extent that they represent **reasonable, objective and proportional** means to **redress de facto discrimination** and are **discontinued** when substantive  equality has been **sustainably achieved**. Such **positive measures may exceptionally, however, need to be of a permanent nature**, such as interpretation services for linguistic minorities and reasonable accommodation of persons with sensory impairments in accessing health-care facilities. ICESCR General Comment 20, paragraph 9




## When different treatment is justified
Sometimes, to protect and ensure human rights, different treatment is justified. For example, 

> In order to fulfil the obligation set forth in article 3, States parties **should take account of the factors which impede** the equal enjoyment by women and men of each right specified in the Covenant. ICCPR General Comment 28, paragraph 6


> Finally, the Committee observes that not every differentiation of treatment will constitute discrimination, if the criteria for such differentiation are reasonable and objective and if the aim is to achieve a purpose which is legitimate under the Covenant. CCPR General Comment 18, paragraph 10


### Reasonable

### Objective

### Necessary
Different treatment must be necessary to reach the intended goals. If a program or policy can meet the goals of protecting or supporting a groups human rights by universal means, then different treatment is not necessary.

## Required
>  The Committee wishes to draw the attention of States parties to the fact that the Covenant **sometimes expressly requires them to take measures to guarantee the equality of rights of the persons concerned**. For example, article 23, paragraph 4, stipulates that States parties shall take appropriate steps to ensure equality of rights as well as responsibilities of spouses as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. Such steps may take the form of legislative, administrative or other measures, but it is a positive duty of States parties to make certain that spouses have equal rights as required by the Covenant. ICCPR General Comment 18, paragraph 5

## Not justified
> In becoming parties to the Covenant, States undertake, in accordance with article 3, to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil and political rights set forth in the Covenant, and in accordance with article 5, **nothing in the Covenant may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights provided for in article 3**, or at limitations not covered by the Covenant. ICCPR General Comment 28, paragraph 9



## Discrimination in the application of affirmative action.
Men have the same right to affirmative action as women. If affirmative action is not apply to men in a situation where it would be applied to women then that is discrimination.
