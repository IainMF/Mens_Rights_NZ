# Infanticide
Section 178 of the Crimes Act 1961 allows mothers who murder their children when they are experiencing mental illness to be charged with the less severe crime of *infanticide*.  Infanticide has a maximum 3 year prison sentence where murder has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Research shows that mental health issues like postnatal depression are a risk for both mothers and fathers. In New Zealand, there is at least one case of a man being charged with murder where a woman he would have been charged with infanticide.[^1]
