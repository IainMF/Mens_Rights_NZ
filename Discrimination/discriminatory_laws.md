description: New Zealand has laws that discriminate against men and boys violating their right to be free from discrimination and their right to equality under the law.

> [!tip] This page is a work in progress


Men have the right to be treated equally under the law. Article 7 of the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* states: 
> All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law".

The Article 26 of the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* states:
> All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.

The Human Rights Commission states:
> In a free and democratic society (such as New Zealand purports to be) laws should be non-discriminatory on their face, unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified.[^1]

Unfortunately, New Zealand has several laws that discriminate against men.

## Male Assaults Female

Section 194 of the 1961 Crimes Act includes *male-assaults-female*. It covers assaults that are equivalent to 'common assault'; however, *male-assaults-female* has a longer maximum sentence (2 years instead of 1 year). This violates men's right to equal treatment under the law.[^2] 

In 2009 the Law Commission reviewed part eight of the Crimes Act[^3] and recommended repealing the *male-assaults-female* offence. They identify some negative aspects to having this charge and note that the main reason to keep the charge was it was symbolic of the seriousness of the crime. However, *male-assaults-female* is only available for minor incidents and more serious assaults will merit a more serious charge, so much of the symbolism is lost.

*Male-assaults-female* was used as a proxy to address family violence. The introduction of the Family and Whānau Violence Legislation Bill addressed the shortcomings of using *male-assaults-female* to address family violence. After all, family violence includes more than just a male assaulting a female. 

Both Amy Adams,[^4] justice minister for the introduction of the bill, and the Human Rights Commission recognised the limitation of male assaults female to address family violence. The Human Rights Commission states: “The law should reflect the seriousness of the assault and not the gender of the victim and perpetrator.”[^5]

Despite the shortcomings of *male-assaults-female* being addressed in the proposed bill and the ineffectiveness of using the law for symbolic purposes Amy Adams recommended not repealing *male-assaults-female* because of the symbolism. “Retaining the offence of male assaults female will ensure the law continues to acknowledge the seriousness of gendered violence even outside the context of family violence."[^6]

### Other concerns about male assaults female
Men charged with *male-assaults-female* do not qualify for the more lenient 'bail of as right' provisions granted to persons charged with common assault.

The Criminal Investigations (Bodily Samples) Act 1995 allows investigators the ability to take bodily samples from people accused of *male assaults female*. The equivalent common assault is not.

### History of male assaults female

In New Zealand, a specific crime of assaulting a female goes back at least as far as the *1867 Offences Against the Person Act*. Any person assaulting a male child (under 14) or a female of any age could be punished more harshly if the Justices determined that “it cannot in their opinion be sufficiently punished under the provisions hereinbefore contained as to common assaults”. Common assault had a penalty of prison not exceeding two months, with or without hard labour, and/or a fine of ten pounds. Assaulting a child or a female had a penalty of imprisonment not exceeding six months, with or without hard labour, and/or a fine of twenty pounds. *The Indictable Offences Summary Jurisdiction Act 1894* and *The Justices of the Peace Act 1927* updated the wording but the penalties remained the same.

The *Police Offences Amendment Act (No 2) 1952* introduced some changes. Firstly, that the assaulting a child or a female was a crime in its own right, not just a decision of the justices when the punishment common assault was insufficient for the nature of the act. Secondly, only males could be charged with the specific crime of assaulting a female. The *Crimes Act 1961* is the latest implementation of the *male-assaults-female* law.

## Infanticide

Section 178 of the Crimes Act 1961 allows mothers who murder their children when they are experiencing mental illness to be charged with the less severe crime of *infanticide*.  Infanticide has a maximum 3 year prison sentence where murder has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. If the circumstances permit, a jury may return a verdict of infanticide instead of murder or manslaughter.

Research shows that mental health issues like postnatal depression are a risk for both mothers and fathers. In New Zealand, there is at least one case of a man being charged with murder where a woman he would have been charged with infanticide.

> Another class of ‘neither nor’ defendants are the ‘deserving cases’. These are defendants suffering some mental impairment who, because of their circumstances, deserve reduced culpability in a way the law currently fails to provide. For example, in R v W the defendant, a loving father, learnt that his baby child had been born with the worst survivable brain dysfunction and would never have independent functioning. Consequently, the defendant became mentally debilitated and developed acute stress disorder (recognised in ICD-10), which was a causal factor in him killing the baby. He was held to be sane. As shall be discussed, infanticide is the only statutory form of reduced culpability for defendants suffering mental impairment short of insanity in New Zealand. **However, infanticide is only available to mothers who kill their children, so the defendant here was charged with murder.**[^7]

There is some support to replace infanticide with a gender neutral law.

> Otago University law professor Kevin Dawkins … said he would like to see infanticide replaced with another partial defence of diminished responsibility, to apply to female and male offenders.[^8]

### History of Infanticide
Infanticide was introduced in the 1961 Crimes Act and was based on the United Kingdom Infanticide Act 1938. 


## Adoption
Section 4(2) the Adoption Act 1955 places additional restrictions on men wanting to adopt a female child. The law states:

> "An adoption order shall not be made in respect of a child who is a female in favour of a sole applicant who is a male unless the court is satisfied that the applicant is the father of the child or that there are special circumstances which justify the making of an adoption order."


In 2016, the Human Rights Review Tribunal has declared that Section 4(2) the Adoption Act 1955 to be inconsistent with the right to be free from discrimination. The government has not addressed this inconsistency.

The United Nations Human Rights Committee has recommended:

>  \[New Zealand] should amend the Adoption Act 1955 and repeal all of its discriminatory provisions, and consider permitting civil union partners to adopt children.[^9]

The Human Rights Commission identified Section 4(2) of the Adoption Act 1955 as discriminatory against men.[^10]


## Healthy Futures Act
One of the objectives of the Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Act 2022 is to "achieve equity in health outcomes among New Zealand's population groups, including by striving to eliminate health disparities".[^11] However, the Act requires the Ministry of Health to create a women's health strategy, but not a men's health strategy. Mongolia, Australia, Ireland, Iran, Malaysia, South Africa, Brazil, and the state of Quebec all have men's health strategies.

 Jehan Casinader reports "When I asked the Ministry of Health to tell me about its initiatives focused specifically on men, I heard  \[nothing\]. Although it has a women's health strategy, New Zealand does not have a men's health strategy, and the ministry has no plans to develop one."[^12]
## Protection from Genital Mutilation
In 1996 female genital mutilation became illegal in New Zealand. There is no equivalent protection for males. While discussing intersex children, the Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended “that no one is subjected to unnecessary medical or surgical treatment during infancy or childhood, guaranteeing the rights of children to bodily integrity, autonomy and self-determination”[^13] This should apply to all children including boys.

Hammond and Carmack argue that non-therapeutic infant circumcision violates a child’s rights to religious freedom, bodily autonomy and protection from harm.

> Findings highlight important health and human rights implications resulting from infringements on the bodily integrity and future autonomy rights of boys… [^14]

Martin Robbins argues that men should be able to choose whether they are circumcised or not

> Men should have the right to choose circumcision, not have the choice forced upon them. Infant circumcision without consent or immediate medical justification is an unjustified violation of basic human rights, that shares more in common with ancient coming-of-age rituals than responsible medical practice. [^15]

## Rape and Sexual Assault
Section 128 of the Crimes Act 1961 defines *rape* as: 

> Person A rapes person B if person A has sexual connection with person B, effected by the penetration of person B’s genitalia by person A’s penis,—
> (a) without person B’s consent to the connection; and
> (b) without believing on reasonable grounds that person B consents to the connection. 


Section 128 continues to define *unlawful sexual connection*:
> Person A has unlawful sexual connection with person B if person A has sexual connection with person B—
> (a) without person B’s consent to the connection; and
> (b) without believing on reasonable grounds that person B consents to the connection.

This gendered definition means that, expect in rare circumstances, only men can be charged with rape. Sentencing for guidelines for rape and unlawful sexual connection differently. See *Sentencing guidelines for sexual offences*.

The gendered definition creates several problems. Firstly, male victims who were forced to penetrate are denied equal levels of justice compared to female rape victims.

Secondly, the gendered definition of rape confuses statistics on rape and sexual assault. Nearly all rapists are men and most rape victims are women, but this would be true regardless of the prevalence due to the gendered definition of rape. 

Thirdly, journalists reporting on female perpetrated sexual assaults cannot call them rapes. 

Fourthly, rapists are stigmatised for their crimes. The stigma is not so great for sexual assault, which means male and female perpetrators do not experience the same stigma.

### History of rape law
The _Criminal Code Bill 1886_ defines "Rape is the act of a male person, not under the age of fourteen years, having carnal knowledge of a woman who is not his wife" without her consent.


## Other discrimination in law.
Some other laws treat men less favoutbaly than women.
### Equal pay
The Equal Pay Act 1972 does not offer the same protection to men in jobs that are predominately male as it does for women in jobs that are predominately female. The law assumes that women will always be the ones disadvantaged in matters of equal pay.

### Good employer
The Public Service Act 2020 requires the public service to be good employers. A good employer "is an employer who operates an employment policy containing provisions generally accepted as necessary for the fair and proper treatment of employees in all aspects of their employment, including for ... recognition of the employment requirements of women." The law assumes that women have different employment requirements from men, but there is no requirement to recognise the employment requirements of men. 

## Historically

### Flogging or whipping
Section 67 of _Offences Against the Person Act 1867_ allows whipping as a punishment for males only. The _Criminal Code Act of 1893_ prohibits flogging or whipping of females. Flogging is the use of a cat-o’-nine-tails and whipping is done with a rod. The _Indictable Offences Summary Jurisdiction Act 1894_ allows young males convicted of crimes to be whipped. 12-16 year old boys can be whipped 12 times or less, and boys under 12 can be whipped 6 times or less. The _Crimes Amendment Act 1941_ ended the use of flogging and whipping as a punishment.
 
### Jury service
Historically, only men were required to serve on a jury. Men who refused to serve when required were fined. See (Juries Act of 1868,1908). The *Women Jurors Act 1942* allowed women to opt-in to jury service by notifying “the Sheriff in writing that she desires to serve as a juror”. Once a woman had opted-in she was liable for the same fines as a man. The *Juries Amendment Act 1963* changed jury service for women to be opt-out. Women could excuse themselves from jury duty by writing to the Sheriff and explaining they did not want to serve. The *Juries Amendment Act 1976* "provided for equal responsibility for jury service for men and women by the application of the same grounds for exemption from jury service."[^17]

### Assisting police officers
The _Police Force Act 1913_ requires adult males to assist police officers in securing or conveying a prisoner to a police station, when it is reasonably necessary. Men who fail to assist an officer when called upon could be fined.

In New Zealand's 1987 CEDAW report:

> In 1975, in the provision of death benefits, there was a presumption that where a husband and wife were living together, the wife was totally dependent on the husband, in the absence of proof to the contrary. ==This provision, which discriminated against widowers==, was removed in the 1982 Social Security Amendment Act. The benefit on death is now available to widowers on the same basis as to widows.
> 
> ==There are some areas where women have more rights than men in the present social security legislation.== A "male breadwinner" assumption remains in the Social Security Act, 1964, in Sections 21 and 27C. Men who are widowers do not qualify for a widows benefit under Section 21, but may, if they have one or more dependent children, qualify for the domestic purposes benefit under Section 27B. They cannot, however, qualify for a domestic purposes benefit under the “woman alone" provisions.[^16]



### 3.2

The following is a list of Acts which have the effect of promoting sex equality in New Zealand:

#### Matrimonial Property Act 1976  
This statute is described as an Act to recognise the equal contribution of husband and wife to the marriage partnership and to provide a just distribution of matrimonial property between spouses. It provides a rebuttable presumption of equal division of the matrimonial property when a marriage breaks down. Matrimonial property is, broadly, property acquired after the marriage through the work or service of either spouse but not by inheritance or gift. The presumption may be displaced if the marriage is short (three years or less); if equal division of the home and chattels would be repugnant to justice; or, in respect of other matrimonial property, if one spouse has made a clearly greater contribution to the marriage partnership.

Contributions are defined broadly. There is no presumption that contribution in monetary form is of greater value than any other kind.

  *Matrimonial Property Act 1976*—Provided for a more equitable division of property on the dissolution of a marriage,

#### Evidence Amendment Act 1977  
This provides that in rape trials evidence relating to a complainant's sexual experience or reputation is excluded except where exclusion would be contrary to the interests of justice.

  *Evidence Amendment Act 1980*—Provided some restrictions on the cross-examination or presentation of evidence pertaining to a victim's sexual history.

#### Domicile Act 1976 
This Act provides for the separate domicile of married women.

#### Juries Amendment Act 1976 (now part of the Juries Act 1981)  
This provided for equal responsibility for jury service for men and women by the application of the same grounds for exemption from jury service.

#### Government Superannuation Fund Amendment Act 1976  
This removes the requirement that the widower of the superannuitant prove that he was financially dependent upon his wife before being entitled to the surviving spouse benefit.

#### Human Rights Commission Act 1977  
This prohibits discrimination on the ground of sex in the fields of employment, education, accommodation, landholding, goods and services, access to public places and public facilities; and prohibits sexual discrimination in advertisements or notices about any of these matters.

Enforcement is by way of mediation by the Human Rights Commission. Where this is unsatisfactory proceedings may be brought before the Equal Opportunities Tribunal and there is a right of appeal to the Administrative Division of the High Court.

In addition, the Human Rights Commission has important general functions intended to effect the eradication of discrimination through education.

#### Citizenship Act 1977  
Accorded all New Zealand citizens the same rights with respect to the citizenship of spouses and children.

#### State Services Amendment Act 1978  
This gives members of the Public Service resigning for child care purposes preferential re-entry rights to the service up to four years after resignation or five years in the case of a woman entitled to maternity leave.

#### Family Proceedings Act 1980  
This removes discrimination in the assessment of maintenance by providing that spouses have the same liability to maintain each other, and institutes a no-fault dissolution of marriage by making two years separation the only ground for divorce.

#### Guardianship Amendment Act 1980  
This makes it quite clear that neither parent is to be preferred as the custodial parent solely by reason of sex.

#### Maternity Leave and Employment Protection Act 1980  
This entitles a woman to six months maternity leave without pay where the woman has worked for an employer for at least 15 hours a week for at least 18 months before the expected date of delivery.

The woman is also entitled to some job protection in that the employer is required to keep her job open (although there are exceptions). If re-employment cannot be guaranteed the employer must give her preference for re-employment for six months after the end of her maternity leave. The Act prohibits dismissal because of pregnancy.

#### Social Security Amendment Acts 1976, 1978, 1979  
The 1976 Act provides the right to social security at age 60 on the same terms for all women and men, and the 1978 and 1979 provisions grant all other weekly benefits (except widows) on the same terms to men and women.

  *Social Security Amendment Act 1973*—Established the domestic purposes benefit for solo parents.

  *Social Security Amendment Act 1977*—Introduced national superannuation without discrimination.

  *Social Security Amendment Act 1979*—-Provided for the payment of sickness and unemployment benefits to women and men on an equal basis.

#### Repeal of Section 13 of the Factories and Commercial Premises Act 1981 Order 1982  
The Factories and Commercial Premises Act 1981 contained a section limiting the hours of employment of women in factories. The section provided for its own repeal by the Governor-General when New Zealand ceased to be bound by International Labour Organisation Convention 89 covering night work of women employed in industry. The section was repealed on 2 April 1982 by the repeal of section 13 of the Factories and Commercial Premises Act 1981 Order 1982.

 *Factories and Commercial Premises Amendment Act 1981*—Lifted restrictions on women working during night hours.

#### Domestic Protection Act 1982  
This provides new and improved remedies for the victims of domestic violence, married or unmarried.

#### Estate and Gift Duties Amendment Act 1983  
This provides for a gift duty exemption where a matrimonial property agreement results in the non-owner spouse receiving half the matrimonial property. There have also been consequential changes in the income tax legislation recognising the equal sharing principle of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976.

## Legislation — 
The following legislation, either removing legal discriminations against women or directly aimed at assisting women, has been passed since 1970.

*Domestic Proceedings Amendment Act 1971*—Extended provisions for maintenance orders.

*Equal Pay Act 1972*— Established the principle of equal pay for equal work without discrimination on the basis of sex.

*Accident Compensation Amendment Act 1973*—Extended compensation provisions to non-earners.

*Family Courts Act 1980*—Removed family law to special court with special support services.

*Family Proceedings Act 1980*—Introduced no fault dissolution of marriage, and revised the law relating to matrimonial and domestic proceedings.

*Guardianship Amendment Act 1980*—Introduced custodial provisions which ensure that the welfare of the child is paramount and no one person can be preferred as custodial parent on the basis of sex.

*Maternity Leave and Employment Protection Act 1980*—Guaranteed up to 26 weeks unpaid leave to most women workers expecting a baby or planning to adopt a young child.

*Domestic Protection Act 1982*—Extended protection to the victims of domestic violence in whatever situation this occurs.

*Coal Mines Amendment Act 1983*—Provided for the repeal of the restriction on employment of women underground. New Zealand is no longer bound by the International Labour Convention 45.

*Estate and Gift Duties Amendment Act 1983*—Provided for a gift duty exemption where a matrimonial property agreement results in the non-owner spouse receiving half the matrimonial property.
