title: Discrimination against men in New Zealand’s laws.
description: New Zealand's laws explicitly discriminate against men and boys violating their right to equality under the law.
---

Men have the right to be treated equally under the law. Article 7 of the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* states: 
> All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law".

The Article 26 of the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* states:
> All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.

The Human Rights Commission states:
> In a free and democratic society (such as New Zealand purports to be) laws should be non-discriminatory on their face, unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified.^[Human Rights Commission. *Submission of the Human Rights Commission
as Intervener in Adoption Action Inc v Attorney-General*, 2013.]

Unfortunately, New Zealand has several laws that discriminate against men.

## Male Assaults Female
Section 194 of the 1961 Crimes Act includes *male-assaults-female*. It covers assaults that are equivalent to 'common assault'; however, male-assaults-female has a longer maximum sentence (2 years instead of 1 year) and does not fall under the more lenient 'bail of as right' provisions granted to persons charged with common assault.
    
In 2009 the Law Commission reviewed part eight of the Crimes Act^[Review of Part 8 of the Crimes Act 1961: crimes against the person [https://bit.ly/2LQuRv5](https://bit.ly/2LQuRv5)] and recommended repealing the ‘male-assaults-female’ offence. They identify some negative aspects to having this charge and note that the main reason to keep the charge was it was symbolic of the seriousness of the crime. However, male-assaults-female is only available for minor incidents and more serious assaults will merit a more serious charge, so much of the symbolism is lost.

Male-assaults-female was used as a proxy to address family violence. The introduction of the Family and Whānau Violence Legislation Bill addressed the shortcomings of using male-assaults-female to address family violence. After all, family violence includes more than just a male assaulting a female. 

Both Amy Adams,^[ Reform Of Family Violence Law – Paper Three: Prosecuting family violence – Cabinet Social Policy Committee [https://bit.ly/2MoYwNh](https://bit.ly/2MoYwNh) – paragraph 35] justice minister for the introduction of the bill, and the Human Rights Commission recognised the limitation of male assaults female to address family violence. The Human Rights Commission states: “The law should reflect the seriousness of the assault and not the gender of the victim and perpetrator.”^[Submission of the Human Rights Commission on the Family and Whānau Violence Legislation Bill [https://bit.ly/2Jz5tgV](https://bit.ly/2Jz5tgV)]


Despite the shortcomings of male-assaults-female being addressed in the proposed bill and the ineffectiveness of using the law for symbolic purposes Amy Adams recommended not repealing male assaults female because of the symbolism. “Retaining the offence of male assaults female will ensure the law continues to acknowledge the seriousness of gendered violence even outside the context of family violence."^[ Reform Of Family Violence Law – Paper Three: Prosecuting family violence – Cabinet Social Policy Committee [https://bit.ly/2JFzt6K](https://bit.ly/2JFzt6K)]

## Infanticide
Section 178 of the Crimes Act 1961 allows mothers who murder their children when they are experiencing mental illness to be charged with the less severe crime of *infanticide*.  Infanticide has a maximum 3 year prison sentence where murder has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Research shows that mental health issues like postnatal depression are a risk for both mothers and fathers. In New Zealand, there is at least one case of a man being charged with murder where a woman he would have been charged with infanticide.^[ Westway, Thomas --- "Guilty But Substantially Mentally Impaired" [2011] NZLawStuJl 2; (2011) 2 New Zealand Law Students' Journal 470 - [http://archive.li/TtqTm](http://archive.li/TtqTm)]

## Adoption
The Human Rights Commission identified Section 4(2) of the Adoption Act 1955 as discriminatory against men.^[ Human Rights Commission. *Submission of the Human Rights Commission as Intervener in Adoption Action Inc v Attorney-General*. 2013]
The law states: 
> "An adoption order shall not be made in respect of a child who is a female in favour of a sole applicant who is a male unless the court is satisfied that the applicant is the father of the child or that there are special circumstances which justify the making of an adoption order."
## Healthy Futures Act
One of the objectives of the Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Act 2022 is to "achieve equity in health outcomes among New Zealand's population groups, including by striving to eliminate health disparities".^[Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Act 2022 Section 3(b)] However, the Act requires the Ministry of Health to create a women's health strategy, but not a men's health strategy. Mongolia, Australia, Ireland, Iran, Malaysia, South Africa, Brazil, and the state of Quebec all have men's health strategies.

 Jehan Casinader reports "When I asked the Ministry of Health to tell me about its initiatives focused specifically on men, I heard  \[nothing\]. Although it has a women's health strategy, New Zealand does not have a men's health strategy, and the ministry has no plans to develop one."^[https://www.1news.co.nz/2024/06/08/drink-less-booze-and-check-your-testes-why-do-nz-men-get-minimal-health-support/]
## Protection from Genital Mutilation
In 1996 female genital mutilation became illegal in New Zealand. There is no equivalent protection for males. While discussing intersex children, the Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended “that no one is subjected to unnecessary medical or surgical treatment during infancy or childhood, guaranteeing the rights of children to bodily integrity, autonomy and self-determination”^[ Concluding observations on the fifth periodic report of New Zealand - CRC/C/NZL/CO/5 paragraph 25 (b)] This should apply to all children including boys.
## Rape and Sexual Assault
Section 128 of the Crimes Act 1961 defines *rape* as: 

> Person A rapes person B if person A has sexual connection with person B, effected by the penetration of person B’s genitalia by person A’s penis,—
> (a) without person B’s consent to the connection; and
> (b) without believing on reasonable grounds that person B consents to the connection. 


Section 128 continues to define *unlawful sexual connection*:
> Person A has unlawful sexual connection with person B if person A has sexual connection with person B—
> (a) without person B’s consent to the connection; and
> (b) without believing on reasonable grounds that person B consents to the connection.

This gendered definition means that, expect in rare circumstances, only men can be charged with rape. Sentencing for guidelines for rape and unlawful sexual connection differently. See *Sentencing guidelines for sexual offences*.

The gendered definition creates several problems. Firstly, male victims who were forced to penetrate are denied equal levels of justice compared to female rape victims.

Secondly, the gendered definition of rape confuses statistics on rape and sexual assault. Nearly all rapists are men and most rape victims are women, but this would be true regardless of the prevalence due to the gendered definition of rape. 

Thirdly, journalists reporting on female perpetrated sexual assaults cannot call them rapes. 

Fourthly, rapists are stigmatised for their crimes. The stigma is not so great for sexual assault, which means male and female perpetrators do not experience the same stigma.
