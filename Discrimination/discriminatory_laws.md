title: Discrimination New Zealand’s laws.
description: New Zealand's laws explicitly discriminate against men and boys violating their right to be free from discrimination and their right to equality under the law.
---

Men have the right to be treated equally under the law. Article 7 of the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* states: 
> All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law".

The Article 26 of the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* states:
> All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.

The Human Rights Commission states:
> In a free and democratic society (such as New Zealand purports to be) laws should be non-discriminatory on their face, unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified.[^1]

Unfortunately, New Zealand has several laws that discriminate against men.

## Male Assaults Female
Section 194 of the 1961 Crimes Act includes *male-assaults-female*. It covers assaults that are equivalent to 'common assault'; however, male-assaults-female has a longer maximum sentence (2 years instead of 1 year) and does not fall under the more lenient 'bail of as right' provisions granted to persons charged with common assault.
    
In 2009 the Law Commission reviewed part eight of the Crimes Act[^2] and recommended repealing the ‘male-assaults-female’ offence. They identify some negative aspects to having this charge and note that the main reason to keep the charge was it was symbolic of the seriousness of the crime. However, male-assaults-female is only available for minor incidents and more serious assaults will merit a more serious charge, so much of the symbolism is lost.

Male-assaults-female was used as a proxy to address family violence. The introduction of the Family and Whānau Violence Legislation Bill addressed the shortcomings of using male-assaults-female to address family violence. After all, family violence includes more than just a male assaulting a female. 

Both Amy Adams,[^3] justice minister for the introduction of the bill, and the Human Rights Commission recognised the limitation of male assaults female to address family violence. The Human Rights Commission states: “The law should reflect the seriousness of the assault and not the gender of the victim and perpetrator.”[^4]


Despite the shortcomings of male-assaults-female being addressed in the proposed bill and the ineffectiveness of using the law for symbolic purposes Amy Adams recommended not repealing male assaults female because of the symbolism. “Retaining the offence of male assaults female will ensure the law continues to acknowledge the seriousness of gendered violence even outside the context of family violence."[^5]

### Other concerns about male assaults female
The Criminal Investigations (Bodily Samples) Act 1995 allows investigators the ability to take bodily samples from people accused of certain crimes. Male assaults female is one of those crimes. The equivalent common assault is not.

## Infanticide

Section 178 of the Crimes Act 1961 allows mothers who murder their children when they are experiencing mental illness to be charged with the less severe crime of *infanticide*.  Infanticide has a maximum 3 year prison sentence where murder has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Research shows that mental health issues like postnatal depression are a risk for both mothers and fathers. In New Zealand, there is at least one case of a man being charged with murder where a woman he would have been charged with infanticide.

> Another class of ‘neither nor’ defendants are the ‘deserving cases’. These are defendants suffering some mental impairment who, because of their circumstances, deserve reduced culpability in a way the law currently fails to provide. For example, in R v W the defendant, a loving father, learnt that his baby child had been born with the worst survivable brain dysfunction and would never have independent functioning. Consequently, the defendant became mentally debilitated and developed acute stress disorder (recognised in ICD-10), which was a causal factor in him killing the baby. He was held to be sane. As shall be discussed, infanticide is the only statutory form of reduced culpability for defendants suffering mental impairment short of insanity in New Zealand. **However, infanticide is only available to mothers who kill their children, so the defendant here was charged with murder.**[^6]

There is some support to replace infanticide with a gender neutral law.

> Otago University law professor Kevin Dawkins … said he would like to see infanticide replaced with another partial defence of diminished responsibility, to apply to female and male offenders.[^7]

## Adoption
The Human Rights Commission identified Section 4(2) of the Adoption Act 1955 as discriminatory against men.[^8]
The law states:

> "An adoption order shall not be made in respect of a child who is a female in favour of a sole applicant who is a male unless the court is satisfied that the applicant is the father of the child or that there are special circumstances which justify the making of an adoption order."

## Healthy Futures Act
One of the objectives of the Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Act 2022 is to "achieve equity in health outcomes among New Zealand's population groups, including by striving to eliminate health disparities".[^9] However, the Act requires the Ministry of Health to create a women's health strategy, but not a men's health strategy. Mongolia, Australia, Ireland, Iran, Malaysia, South Africa, Brazil, and the state of Quebec all have men's health strategies.

 Jehan Casinader reports "When I asked the Ministry of Health to tell me about its initiatives focused specifically on men, I heard  \[nothing\]. Although it has a women's health strategy, New Zealand does not have a men's health strategy, and the ministry has no plans to develop one."[^10]
## Protection from Genital Mutilation
In 1996 female genital mutilation became illegal in New Zealand. There is no equivalent protection for males. While discussing intersex children, the Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended “that no one is subjected to unnecessary medical or surgical treatment during infancy or childhood, guaranteeing the rights of children to bodily integrity, autonomy and self-determination”[^11] This should apply to all children including boys.

Hammond and Carmack argue that non-therapeutic infant circumcision violates a child’s rights to religious freedom, bodily autonomy and protection from harm.

> Findings highlight important health and human rights implications resulting from infringements on the bodily integrity and future autonomy rights of boys… [^12]

Martin Robbins argues that men should be able to choose whether they are circumcised or not

> Men should have the right to choose circumcision, not have the choice forced upon them. Infant circumcision without consent or immediate medical justification is an unjustified violation of basic human rights, that shares more in common with ancient coming-of-age rituals than responsible medical practice. [^13]

## Rape and Sexual Assault
Section 128 of the Crimes Act 1961 defines *rape* as: 

> Person A rapes person B if person A has sexual connection with person B, effected by the penetration of person B’s genitalia by person A’s penis,—
> (a) without person B’s consent to the connection; and
> (b) without believing on reasonable grounds that person B consents to the connection. 


Section 128 continues to define *unlawful sexual connection*:
> Person A has unlawful sexual connection with person B if person A has sexual connection with person B—
> (a) without person B’s consent to the connection; and
> (b) without believing on reasonable grounds that person B consents to the connection.

This gendered definition means that, expect in rare circumstances, only men can be charged with rape. Sentencing for guidelines for rape and unlawful sexual connection differently. See *Sentencing guidelines for sexual offences*.

The gendered definition creates several problems. Firstly, male victims who were forced to penetrate are denied equal levels of justice compared to female rape victims.

Secondly, the gendered definition of rape confuses statistics on rape and sexual assault. Nearly all rapists are men and most rape victims are women, but this would be true regardless of the prevalence due to the gendered definition of rape. 

Thirdly, journalists reporting on female perpetrated sexual assaults cannot call them rapes. 

Fourthly, rapists are stigmatised for their crimes. The stigma is not so great for sexual assault, which means male and female perpetrators do not experience the same stigma.
