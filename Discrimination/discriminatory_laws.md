Men have the right to be treated equally under the law. Article 7 of the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* states: 
> All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law".

The Article 26 of the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* states:
> All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.

The Human Rights Commission states:
> In a free and democratic society (such as New Zealand purports to be) laws should be non-discriminatory on their face, unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified.^[Human Rights Commission. *Submission of the Human Rights Commission
as Intervener in Adoption Action Inc v Attorney-General*, 2013.]

Unfortunately, New Zealand has several laws that discriminate agistn men.
